The Morris and Gwendolyn Cafritz Foundation,DC,Latino Economic Development Corporation,Washington,DC,2016,35000,,"LEDC respectfully requests $35,000 in support of its critically needed linguistically and cultural competent community and economic development services in the Greater DC region. More specifically, LEDC is seeking general operating support for its two major program areas- housing and small business development. Our Housing Department consists of two distinct programs- affordable housing preservation through organizing and homeownership and foreclosure counseling. Our Small Business Services Department includes small business development technical assistance and microlending support for aspiring and established entrepreneurs. On an annual basis, across all of our programming, we easily serve over 4,000 low- to moderate- income residents. While LEDC began with a focus on the Latino community in the District of Columbia, over the years, as our capacity, programming, and impact expanded, other communities have sought our services. LEDC began offering small business development training and technical assistance in 1991, homeownership counseling in 1993, small business micro-loans in 1997, and affordable housing preservation in 2004. In terms of our geographic reach, LEDC expanded from DC to MD in 2006 by opening an office in Montgomery County, MD. In 2012 we began lending to clients from Northern Virginia, in February 2014 we began lending operations in Baltimore and this summer we expanded our Baltimore team to include a small business technical assistance coach and secured office space in Baltimore City. While Latinos account for the majority of our client base (we estimate 55%-60%), we also serve African- Americans and immigrants (25%-30%), White/Caucasians (10%), and Asian- Americans and immigrants (less than 5%). Almost all (more than 95%) of our 4,000 clients (with the exception of one or two small business clients and a dozen or so homeownership workshop participants) are low- to moderate- income.",Private,Service
