According to the Center for American Progress a??“State of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders a??Civic Participation and Democracya??? the number of Asian American voters in the last decade has nearly doubled from more than 2 million voters in 2000 to 3.9 million voters in 2012. If future rates of change are projected for each racial group, based on trends over the past four presidential elections they estimate Asian Americans will reach 5 percent of the voting population by 2025 and 10 percent of the voting population by 2044. Looking next at counties, AAPIs are 5 percent or more of the CVAP in 73 jurisdictions, including 33 jurisdictions where they are greater than 10 percent. When looking at congressional districts, there are 10 where AAPIs account for more than 25 percent of the CVAP, 35 districts where they account for between 10 percent and 25 percent, and 58 districts where they account for between 5 percent and 10 percent.,,APIAVote is taking steps to increase the voter participation rate among Asian American and Pacific Islanders by increasing the number of local nonprofits engaged in this work. We recognize the diversity of this community when looking at its ethnicity, national origin, and age. Due to this we need to engage trusted messengers and organizations for each individualized community. In 2012, we identified and worked with 26 nonprofits and local coalitions in 14 states and for 2014, we have 34 organizations participating representing 17 states. Each organization varies in size and structure. Some of them have full time staff and others are volunteer run organizations, but they all are willing to learn how to implement a local voter engagement program at some level. APIAVotea?¬â„¢s goal is to meet them where they are, provide a good experience in this work, and continue to help them scale their program as they increase their capacity and volunteer base. ,,As a result, APIAVote has scheduled 17 trainings around the country where local organizations are expected to draw a minimum of 40 participants. The day long training encompasses modules on the following: the potential of the AAPI electorate, overview of campaigns, voter registration 101, how to talk to and mobilize voters, election protection and the voting rights act, volunteer recruitment and management, base building, and campaign planning. Afterwards we work with the local organization in creating their local field plans based on their capacity. Since we have limited resources in 2014, we are looking to implement a more controlled local program where local partners will reach out in a culturally appropriate manner to a set group of voters with 3-4 touches; Grant made through SIF - State Infrastructure Fund",Private,Advocacy

The mission of the Asian Center is to support and empower Asian people while sharing our cultures with the entire community through our programs and services. The Center's services and programs focus on increasing the stability of immigrant and refugee families who face economic and cultural barriers to self-sufficiency as New Americans. While the needs that this population faces may be common, no other entity in Lincoln provides these culturally specific services for Asians and other New Americans. The Center is a hive of activity providing translation and interpretation services in Vietnamese, Karen, Arabic and Mandarin languages daily for INS document preparation assistance, tax filing assistance, employment assistance, and health care support. The Center hosts many ELL classes that focus on conversation skills, advanced writing, and pronunciation. We have multiple citizenship classes that not only help prepare students for taking their citizenship exam, but also help them learn about their new country, state, and city. We're launching Creating Lasting Family Connections in three language to teach parents and teens communication skills and reduce substance abuse. Our senior, women's and youth programs engage these age groups with their communities to make them happier, healthier, and safer with our educational activities. The Center's cultural education program allows us to do outreach in the community with our newly formed Cultural Arts Troupe, made up of six individual groups. Also, we host cultural festivals and celebrations that bring people together to learn about, recognize, and celebrate their unique cultural and ethnic origins. We also want listen and respond to community requests and needs such as a new driver's extended education program. ACT test preparation classes, and a film/book discussion series.",Private,Service

API-equality has been working for the past nine years towards a society free from discrimination and injustice. Even with success in marriage equality efforts nationwide (an issue that API-equality has worked on), other needs within the LGBTQ community in Los Angeles remain as urgent as ever. Asian Pacific Islander LGBTQ people continue to experience discrimination, stereotyping, hatred and bullying, lack of acceptance, rejection and alienation in their everyday lives. Moreover, issues like poverty, poor health outcomes, and immigration challenges affect API LGBTQ people in common with so many, and API-equality brings advocacy expertise in these areas. API Equality-lA brings a politicized lens to the work, continuing to build an active base of volunteers and leaders, and seeks to channel the political power they've built toward other, connected progressive issue battles.",Private,Advocacy
