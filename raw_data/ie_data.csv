In what pollsters predicted would be a close presidential election, Ronald Reagan rode the Republican tidal wave from coast to coast, leaving Jimmy Carter and many Democratic colleagues drowning in its wake. Locally, not all the Democrats went down with the ship. Some comments about particular political races where local Asians organized behind candidates or issues.


President


Asians organized support for Jimmy Carter. There weren't similar Asian groups for either Ronald Reagan or John Anderson, the Independent Party candidate. As everybody knows, Reagan captured more than a majority of the votes, outpolling a combined total for Carter and Anderson.


For minority people, a Reagan presidency sounds downright depressing. During his debate with Carter, Reagan said that when he was growing up, he wasn't aware of racism existing in this country. He has proposed to do away with the minimum wage in his assumption that the minimum wage law is preventing employers from hiring Black youth (the group with the highest unemployment). He intends to cut the budget in order to curb inflation. At the same time, he will increase spending for defense. This means that cuts will be made in other areas like delivery of social services or public employment. Reagan didn't exactly go out of his way to court the minority vote. But he didn't need it. Reagan does not have a strong civil rights record.


Carter tried to make an issue of Reagan's foreign policy. One thing is certain, forget the human rights policy. When Reagan was elected, Taiwan and South Korea were enthusiastic. It's clear that the voters were willing to ignore Reagan's trigger-happy image.


It's hard to predict what Reagan's civil rights record will be. Many folks thought Lyndon Johnson was a racist before he got to the White House, but the Johnson Administration was noted for the passage of many civil rights laws. Of course, Johnson was also president during the Watts, Detroit, and Newark race riots. Reagan will have to deal with minority people. The question is how.


Senate


The Asian community sponsored fundraisers for Senator Warren Magnuson. Maggie has been a dedicated supporter of projects in the International District and was influential in getting funds for social services and housing in our community.


Maggie was caught in the Republican tidal wave as he was beaten convincingly by Slade Gorton, Gorton was apparently very successful in casting Magnuson in the role of a big spender responsible for the inflation cutting holes in the wallets of American taxpayers.


Gorton plans to fulfill his pledge to cut inflation. He is trying to land a spot on the Senate Finance Committee. He has a reputation as a good nuts and bolts legislator.


Magnuson was the senior senator in Congress, having served 44 years. He did a lot for the state. He also was a good friend to the International District. It will be doubtful Gorton can or will do as much. Gorton was another who did not have to depend on the minority vote.


House of Representatives


There were many Asian American supporters for Mike Lowry, the Democratic incumbent congressman in Washington State's Seventh Congressional District. In contrast, Ron Dunlap, the Republican, went virtually unnoticed if not invisible in the minority communities. Bucking the trend that hit hard elsewhere, the liberal Lowry defeated the would-be inflationary fighter Dunlap.


Lowry supported many Asian American concerns. If folks can remember, Lowry sponsored a bill authorizing direct payments for Japanese Americans interned in World War II camps. Lowry has shown his concern for badly needed housing in the International District and has kept in contact with people in the community.


Governor


Many Asian American political activists will never forgive John Spellman's decision to put the Kingdome close to the International District. The wounds have not healed. There was an organized Asian groups supporting his opponent, Democratic candidate Jim McDermott.


This race featured a typical 1980 choice: the liberal, socially conscious Democrat vs. the fiscal conservative Republican. Campaigning as an inflation fighter, Spellman accused his opponent of being a big spender, of raising taxes, and of inflationary policies. Spellman alleged that McDermott would institute a state income tax, a no-no in this election year. His slogans said, ""Spellman is the answer, McDermott is the question."" But what was the question?


Spellman's affirmative action record has been described as adequate. Despite the criticism of Governor Dixy Lee Ray's administration, she appointed Asians to head state agencies, something no other governor, including Dan Evans, did in this state. Spellman did have Asians in mid-level positions while he was King County Executive. Another important factor to consider is that the King County Executive position is now vacant. King County is now homebase for this state's Asian population. Whoever takes the job will hopefully have some sensitivity to Asian American concerns. Incidentally, Spellman, like McDermott and Ray, is on record as supporting redress for Japanese Americans.


Rent Control (Initiative 24)


Several Asian community organizations campaigned and raised funds to support Initiative 24, the rent control issue. The anti-rent control forces, spearheaded by the Washington Coalition for Affordable Housing, raised over $800,000 and spent a record $500,000 to defeat the rent control initiative. In contrast, the pro-rent control forces, coordinated by Renters and Owners Organized for Fairness (ROOF) raised $50,000. Although the anti-rent control group used some questionable advertising tactics (advertisements that gubernatorial candidate McDermott was against rent control when McDermott hadn't taken a position), its message came clear to the voters, ""Build more housing, not more bureaucracy."" In a mood set by Ronald Reagan's promise to get government off the people's back, Seattle voters said ""no"" to rent control by a two to one margin.


It was a frustrating situation. By 5 pm on election day, a full three hours before the polls closed, the networks declared Reagan the winner. By 6:30 pm, Carter conceded. For people here intending to vote in the evening, those announcements were hardly an incentive to vote. It's like knowing how the story ends without reading the story. And it's a slap in the face of west coast voters because of the implication that west coast voters didn't count. Not that it mattered to Carter. But for the Democrats who lost, maybe it made a difference. It's hard to say.


So much for the winners and losers. What's it all mean? For one thing, the Republicans will be blamed for all the problems we will encounter in the 1980s. American is more concerned about its pocketbook than about its poor, sick and disadvantaged. And we won't have Billy Carter to kick around anymore.

It's quite amazing to see how the history of this country seems to go in circles -- a swing to the left, a swing to the right. To observe the direction this country takes in its overall political philosophies is like watching a drunken driver trying to stay on the road.


Over three hundred years ago, the pilgrims (you know the folks that came to dinner with the Indians and didn't leave) left Europe to escape religious persecution. No one was going to tell how to worship God. Today, some of their descendants are rank and file followers of the so-called Moral Majority -- a group that preaches its own special political brand of religious persecution. You know it's ironic that a man named Church (the Idaho senator) was defeated because his political stand wasn't ""moral enough.""


Ten years ago, we had the new left. New political observers speak of the new right. So what is new about the Ku Klux Klan, the American Nazi Party, or even the John Birch society. American Nazi leaders made statements about North Carolina and South Carolina seceding from the U.S. (shades of civil war) to form all-white states. Hey, it may not be a bad idea to put all those bigots, race baiters, White Separatists, and other unmentionables in one place.


Ten years ago people were talking about the need to get out of Vietnam. Today, people talk about the need to get into Iran. Ten years ago, people burned Nixon in effigy. Today, people burn crosses on other people's lawns. Ten years ago, people worked hard to get civil rights laws passed. Today, people are working hard to get civil rights laws repealed. Ten years ago, hippies were the proponents of the counter-culture. Today, they are wearing polyester suits. Many who were anti-establishment back then are the establishment today.


Who would have thought that Eldridge Cleaver, the old Black Panther leader, Eugene McCarthy, the Ku Klux Klan and the John Birch Society would endorse the same candidate (Reagan, of course for President? But then again, who would have thought, ten years ago, that Ronald Reagan would be elected. And it seems inconceivable that Henry ""Scoop"" Jackson is considered too ""liberal."" But he is one of the candidates singled out by the Moral Majority to defeat in 1982.


Fifty years ago, there was the great Depression. The private sector went belly up. The bread lines formed. As a consequence, the Roosevelt Administration made great strides in passing social welfare legislation. The government created jobs because the private sector could not provide jobs for everyone. Wow, today, the cycle is complete. The new president is advocating that the government get out of social welfare and job creation and have the private sector pick it up. The solution to this problem is like answering the question, ""What came first, the chicken or the egg?""


Over a hundred years ago the civil war was fought. Beside the issue of slavery, the war was fought over the question of state's rights. Then, we had a President (Lincoln) who talked about a union of states rights. Today, we have the same argument about states rights. But we have a President (Reagan) who is advocating for states rights.


It has been said that the difference between a liberal and conservative is that a liberal looks to the future and thinks in terms of what it could be and that a conservative looks to the past and thinks in terms of what it was. Well, if history does evolve in cycles, the past is our future and the future is our past.

On January 29, 1981, at his first press conference, President Ronald Reagan announced that his administration was committed to the goals of affirmative action but that he was against ""quotas,"" saying, ""I remember a time when quotas were used to discriminate.""


Well I remember a time too. It's today. But when I use the word ""quota,"" I mean a quota of one -- the token Asian, the token Black, or the token minority. For some employers, the ""quota"" has been increased to include a token woman.


In talking about affirmative action goals, it is hard to conceptualize without talking about numerical goals. Affirmative action was required because minorities were under-represented or unrepresented in an employer's work force. In fact, there is a thin line, often blurred, between a ""numerical goal"" and a ""quota.""


Two recent actions will test Reagan's commitment to affirmative action.


The first concerns an agreement signed by the Carter Administration and a group of Blacks and Hispanics. Blacks and Chicanos contended that the Federal government had used an employment test biased towards whites. Government attorneys agreed and in the waning days of the Carter Administration reached a settlement with the Black and Hispanic plaintiffs. Terms of the settlement included dropping the use of the test and setting hiring goals for Blacks and Hispanics. Now, the Reagan Administration has rescinded the agreement and will not enforce its settlement terms until it has a chance to study the agreement reached.


The second is a recommendation by Reagan's transition team to consider cutting back the budget of the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission, the Federal agency responsible for preventing employment discrimination. The transition team noted an ""antibusiness"" mentality on behalf of the Commission staff.


Reagan has only been in office for two weeks. He has not said he wouldn't enforce the terms of the settlement reached over the government's biased employment test nor has he decided to follow the recommendation to dilute the EEOC. What Reagan does with these two examples will show his commitment to affirmative action.

Doesn't a vacation in Hawaii sound good right about now? Yes! Yes! But unfortunately, I'm not going. Well, maybe you're jetting off to Hawaii but for the majority of us who are ""reveling"" in the Seattle sunshine and cold (it hasn't rained too much this winter, has it?), the almost next best thing to being there is Amerasia Journal's ""Hawall: Issues and Perspectives."" Okay, so it's not the almost next best thing to being there, but it does offer interesting reading about subjects tourists are usually ignorant of. Explored are the experience and attitudes of Hawaiians, Filipinos, Japanese and Chinese in Hawaii on ethnicity, race, class and labor.


Articles discussed the question of ""local identity"" and how current land use policy and development continue to work against the ethnic working class in nonmetropolitan areas, among other topics. Amerasia Journal: ""Hawaii: Issues and Perspectives"" is available for $3 plus state tax from the Asian American Studies Center, 3232 Campbell Hall, University of California at Los Angeles, CA 90024. Published twice-yearly, subscriptions are $6 annually.


What would be better than a trip to Hawaii? For me, it would be a trip to China! And the China Rug Company, Inc., on Capitol Hill, is offering exactly that! CRC is leading an 18-day tour to China to visit cities such as Beijing, Jinan, Quinhaungdao, Tianjin, Qingdao and Hong Kong. Departure date is April 14, 1981, from Seattle. In addition to sightseeing, CRC buyers will be doing business in the cities mentioned and welcome others on the tour to observe negotiations. Cost of the tour includes round-trip airfare, lodging, all meals in Mainland China and all internal transportation for $2,499.00. Further questions can be directed to CRC, 329-4568.

What can we expect from Ronald Reagan's administration? And what is Reaganism as it translates into domestic and foreign policy?


Reagan's election came as a surprise to many of us. But as with Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford and now Carter, the finicky electorate has rallied behind or decisively discharged presidents at the social, economic and political whims of the times. But Reagan's victory wasn't inevitable. Even during midsummer 1980, the big business barometer. The Wall Street Journal, noted that between Reagan, Carter and Anderson, it was still ""none of the above.""


But most significant is Reagan's explicit aim of reversing the Democratic liberalism ushered in by Franklin Roosevelt nearly half a century ago. And despite the Executive Office's limitations (inability to control private oil or auto prices, a powerful Senate, and interest rates set by the Federal Reserve), Reagan is powerful enough to usher in changes coined as Reaganism.


He said it clearest on January 20. ""Government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem.""


He continues: ""We hear much of special interest groups. Well, our concern must be for a special interest group that has been too long neglected. It knows no sectional boundaries, or ethnic and racial divisions; it crosses no political party lines. They are, in short, 'we the people,' this breed called Americans ..."" and ""Let's put America back to work.""


How does he plan to do this? First, by significantly reducing taxes to induce people to spend more and private industry to hire more, thus reviving the slipping economy. He also plans to roll back regulations on oil and gas begun under Carter, hold the line on hiring, and cut back on social spending.


Defense budget increases are promised, to no one's surprise. Carter was headed that way, but conservatives were frustrated with his not-swiftenough emphasis on reversing America's perceived image of vacillation and defeat in the Vietnam War, and in Angola, Nicaragua and Afghanistan. It's just more decisive now. Reaganism in foreign policy may aptly be described as ""The Empire Strikes Back.""


An example of Reagan's philosophy is his proposed tax cuts to private industry if they create jobs in areas of poverty and unemployment, called ""enterprise zones,"" and he may even offer industry sub-minimum wages for youth. This is in contrast to directing funds into more social and public programs.


Reagan's transition teams have been busy developing proposals ranging from getting government out of regulating industry (such as workers' safety protection laws) to backing off on social spending, but still favoring corporate industry (more federal dollars to aid the energy monopolies and continued support for nuclear power).


The effect of Reaganism on state and local government is yet to be felt. It will be quite a challenge for Seattle's traditionally liberal government to deal with. And the loss of United States Senator Warren Magnuson could also have an impact, especially in health care and assistance to the state's economy.


For local I.D. businesses, Reagan's proposed range of tax cuts could be beneficial. If they invest in equipment and expansion, tax cuts could be advantageous, according to a prominent I.D. businessperson. He felt that I.D. businesses should think long-term and invest in such things as computerized seating and accounting and such investments would be tax write-offs. However, as many I.D. businesses are small and family-operated, they tend towards traditional ""day-to-day"" operations.


Any way you cut it, Reagan has the job of closing the gap on growing unemployment and runaway inflation. Liberals and right-wing conservatives have different interpretations of what brought on such problems and what should be done about it. Clearly, the various hues of the Right lament that inflation is caused by idle industries, too much government intervention for the poor, and not enough emphasis on strengthening the U.S.'s strategic capacities and image abroad. Some (the New Right) go further to take up the mantel of stopping society's social and moral disintegration (anti-Equal Rights Amendment, anti-abortion, etc.).


It is beyond the scope of this article to adequately comment on the Right except to say that Carter stood somewhere in between. It was probably such ""indecisiveness"" that cost him the presidency, because the poor were getting poorer, the big industry was not rich enough (at least to receive enough incentive to provide more jobs) and the ""Middle class"" was feeling inflation too close to home.


It's no secret as to who Reagan thinks should sacrifice most, whether in the short run or long run of things. Either way, residents, small businesses, and social service agencies in the I.D. must all come to grips with the forecast ahead, some of us sooner and more painfully than later.

The recent cutback in federal programs are on many people's minds. In this community, it is impossible to ignore the loss of federal funding when you know friends are losing their jobs, agencies will not be able to provide services and people will not be able to receive services. The cold blade in Washington D.C. which is cutting the heart of social service programs is making us bleed in the Asian community.


Life is unfair. After 15 or so years of struggling, we in the Asian community have marched, demonstrated, lobbied and worked hard to reach the point where we are at. Fifteen years ago, we had no community health clinic, no counseling center, no community garden, no day care center, no low-cost housing for elderly, no bilingual education purposes and no community newspapers. The International District was a decaying slum. Asian Americans were not even considered ""minorities"" entitled to the protection of civil rights. If Asians were discriminated against, what could we do about it. Swallow our pride and hope for a better day? It seems a damn shame that we started out with nothing and after all that work, we may end up with very little.


Back in the late 1960s and early 1970s we complained that Asians were not given access to social services. The government responded by saying, ""Show us where the need is."" We worked within the system. We wrote proposals. We identified the problems. We demonstrated the need. And all of this groundwork was laid before the huge influx of Indochinese refugees.


It seems ironic that we have had social service programs funded because we were able to demonstrate the need for such programs. Asian social service programs became necessary because of the language and cultural problems that Asian immigrants had in adjusting to American society. Yet, the Reagan Administration is cutting our programs back. President Reagan assures us that the cuts will not affect the ""truly needy,"" but no one in his administration has given us a definition of ""truly needy.""


It is very hard for me to believe that the cuts will not affect the delivery of services to the ""truly needy"" when I read that the cuts in federal spending affect the handicapped, the poor and the minorities. It is frustrating to read that the Reagan Administration proposes to make substantial cuts in federal aid to Indochinese Refugees, many of whom are illiterate and with no job skills. It is depressing to read that the Reagan Administration proposes to eliminate the Legal Services Corporation, a move which could deny lowincome people access to lawyers which they would not otherwise be able to afford.


Perhaps there has been too much dependence on the federal government to solve our community's, let alone our nation's social problems. But surely a government willing to subsidize tobacco farmers and the Chrysler Corporation must have some responsibility for a problem it helped create. The federal government was looked to as a source for help. Even if it is time for the federal government to stop being a gigantic social service agency, the Reagan Administration should have provided a transitional plan, time for social service agencies to prepare and solutions for adjusting to the loss of the federal funds without having to stop the delivery of services.


But Reagan didn't. Instead, he said that social services and employment training were matters more appropriately handled by local governments and the private sector. Who is he trying to kid? Our state legislature is making a similar response in its budget, tightening welfare eligibility, cutting back on funding for social services and speaking glowingly of the savings ""we"" will have. As for the private sector, where is the profit margin in a bilingual health clinic for low-income people? As for employment training, it would be cheaper for a large corporation to hire someone in an undeveloped country at 23 cents and hour than an unemployed American at the minimum wage, $3.35 an hour, to do its unskilled work. The Reagan Administration has cut back funding to local government and provided no incentive, tax or otherwise, to the private sector to fund either the social services or employment training which will end as a result of Reagan's federal cuts.


Unfortunately, there will be a mad scramble to try and get whatever crumbs of funding are left. Health clinics, social counseling centers, day care centers, battered women's projects, legal services, neighborhood community centers, elderly projects, handicapped groups must compete with each other.


There is a bright side to these disturbing developments. Those of us who have been involved, one way or another, with serving the community have helped many people who might not have made it otherwise in society. Reagan's proposed cutbacks have taught us a valuable lesson. Maybe we became too complacent. It's time to regroup, think of new strategies and use old strategies that work.


Reagan has developed his own ""War on Poverty."" Unfortunately, we are the intended victims. We can wave the white flag or we can work to get around the bayonetted budget. It's fairly obvious we can't turn to the federal government for help this time.

The telegram reads ""information from within the Reagan administration and the Senate authorizing committee reveals that the new administration has no intention of reauthorizing the Community Services Administration (CSA)."" Inter*Im has received operating funds from CSA for the past five years. This grant pays for the salaries of the core staff.


Other CSA funds were allocated through the Hunger Action Program to Inter*Im several years ago as seed money for the development of the I.D. Community Garden. Another appropriation through CSA is for the operation of the food and nutrition program which includes the I.D. Food Buying club. CSA funds come to Inter*Im through a grantee agency, Neighborhood House, which also receives a large portion of operational funds to serve the needs of lowincome families and elderly who reside in Yesler Terrace, Rainier Vista, Holly Park, etc.


The cut of funds to agencies serving the poor, elderly and handicapped will be especially felt in the International District. Programs losing funds will be. Inter*Im, the I.D. Food Buying, the I.D. Community Health Center, the Chinese Information and Services Center and ACRS. The NSA housing program will also be affected because of cuts in federal financing and loan programs. Many of the above agencies receive funds from a variety of sources so that cuts from one source won't necessarily mean the end of the program. Not so with Inter*Im, we receive all of our operating funds from CSA and if we are not picked up by alternative funding sources we would be forced to close our doors. This may be good news to some of your readers but just think, no ""Inter*Im's Corner"" in the International Examiner.


Inter*Im lost its funding several years ago before being picked up by CSA. During a three month period, the director and office manager went on unemployment compensation but worked at Inter*Im full time pro bono. It was during this period that Inter*Im organized the community to develop the charter for the Chinatown/I.D. Preservation and Development Authority. Inter*Im's role the past few years has been one of a catalytic force on behalf of the I.D. to generate funds for housing, health care, nutritional care and general economic development. We have also played the heavy role in stopping unplanned and incompatible development within the I.D., most notably the Port of Seattle's Intermodel Transportation Center, and the King County 300 bed Work Release Program at the Immigration Building.


We at Inter*Im feel our services, coordinating and organizing ability are still needed. Research and planning have gone into the feasibility of instituting an adult day cae facility and/or a congregate care facility. Planning what to do with the Union Pacific Railroad property is still needed. Providing input to Metro's plan for downtown future transportation needs has been one of the duties of Inter*Im these past two years. Inter*Im has played a watch dog role to see that large scale development by public and private industries do not bury this unique community. Many community and non-community persons think Inter*Im doesn't want any new businesses in the I.D. Quite the contrary, we have encouraged expansion of existing businesses and development of compatible economic development. Someone must keep watch on uncontrolled property development that would destroy the residential makeup and the existing, mostly family-owned, businesses which make up the Chinatown and I.D.


We have already witnessed property acquisition of the Rainier Heat and Power Building that will unfortunately force the existing community service businesses out of the I.D. because they will not be able to pay the increased rents the new owner must demand to meet his mortgage payments. We also face the problem of the American Hotel acquisition by the Union Gospel Mission whose programs will cause displacement of the existing, long-term, low-income elderly residents.


We the staff at Inter*Im have always tried to serve the needs of our community and not any one interest group or individual. We would like to stay and serve but we need your help. Please send letters and copies to the following:

""Devastating"" can only begin to capture the impact of Reaganism on social programs.


In announcing his economic program, Reagan heralded it as the most ""innovative"" since the Roosevelt New Deal which ushered in the government's period of social responsibility.


But the ""innovation"" will translate into unparalleled cutbacks or death of programs in the International District.


If figures mean anything, he's calling for a $44 billion budget cut (some senators want 65 more cuts) out of a $695 billion budget. His goal is ""a balanced budget by 1984,"" a sizable feat given that no President has ever done this.


Program cuts will disproportionately hurt the working poor. Tax cuts will disproportionately benefit corporate business and middle to high income individuals.


The defense budget was blessed with the only increase: up $7 billion from Carter's budget.


I.D. programs have felt immediately the sharp edge of the axe; Inter*Im, the I.D.'s umbrella social service and advocacy agency, will lose its entire funding from the Community Services Administration (CSA), a federal program aimed at ameliorating poverty in the cities.


CSA's death is but tied to a larger effort to cut 20 percent from all social, community, and health programs and consolidate these 35 programs into one ""block grant"" allocation to the State. These drastic reductions will kill thousands of categorical programs serving the poor, programs which constitute only 1.04 percent of the federal budget to begin with.


Eight I.D. agencies will need a total $212,000 more to keep present operations through December, 1981. Besides CSA, the National Health Service Corp, CETA, Urban Health Initiative, federal tandem financing for lowincome housing, legal services and mental health services comprise the major cuts.


The I.D. Community Health Clinic's cuts will be exacerbated by the potential closure of the Public Health Hospital, the recipient of many referrals, etc. The Denise Louie Child Care Center Director Kathy Wong also seriously questions the ability of the center to survive after CETA gets axed in September.


Low-income housing construction under the federal Housing and Urban Development Neighborhood Strategy Program (NSA) is at a standstill with tandem financing (7 percent interest loans covering 90 percent of NSA costs) all but gone. The Alki, New Central and Jackson Hotels, all Section 8 rehab projects are affected. One market-rate project, the Adams, is still in need of Section 312 loan funds. But beyond the NSA program, prospects of rehabing the rest of I.D. hotels for low or moderate income housing look grim.


If Reagan has his way, all government housing subsidy programs would be gone and in their place would be tax incentives to entice private investors to build affordable housing. (Another idea is to replace the Section 8 Program with housing vouchers whereby renters would find housing on the private market.) Reagan has yet to explain how investors will produce new or rehabed low-income housing at 18 percent interest rates and without government subsidy. It has yet to be done, particularly in expensive urban land.


Actually, his housing philosophy is tantamount to saying: ""I don't want any more low-income housing built. The poor will have to find whatever affordable housing which ""trickles down"" from higher income housing..."" (That is, if there is any and after it has dilapidated to the point where high income individuals would snuff at it.)


By 1984, Reagan wants defense to increase to 32 percent from 24 percent and ""other"" (which includes social programs) to decrease from 29 percent to 18 percent, according to figures from Mike Lowry's assistant, Ruthann Kurose. With magnificent timing, Reagan unfolded a $50 million cut to a refugee program and a $53 million addition to fund military bands for presidential functions.


But perhaps most important is to remember these cuts have only been proposed by Reagan. They have not yet passed Congress (but soon will) and herein lies our only hope. We must organize to bring pressure on Congress, the state legislature and local government for adequate funding to our programs (see Inter*Im Corner for more details).


This editorial is grimly telling it like it is. The 80s could be a decade of social austerity or a decade of mass uprisings. Reagan has made his first move in the game. If we are to make it clear that we need jobs & bilingual services to the poor, our response must at least parallel, or surpass the numbers of the social movements of the 60s. We cannot forget that it was this movement which gave birth to these social reforms in the first place. Furthermore, there is a guarantee that keeping these programs will be harder in the 80s because of a much worsened political and economic backdrop.


And, there is little time.

International District social service agencies, reeling from Reagan's announcement of massive cutbacks in the flow of federal funds, are scrambling to locate over $200,000 to cover anticipated shortfalls for the last three months of 1981.


Reagan has proposed elimination of all Comprehensive Employment and Training (CETA) public service jobs by the end of September. This action cancels a principal source of funding for the Chinese Information and Service Center (CISC), Denise Louie Child Care Center, International Drop-In Center (IDIC) and International Examiner.


The Reagan administration has also announced that it will not seek reauthorization of the Economic Opportunity Act, a move which could effectively kill the Community Services Administration (CSA), the source of operational funds for anti-poverty agencies like the International District Improvement Association (Inter*Im). CSA also supports CISC's Newcomer Program.


Because of Reagan's announced cutbacks, ID social service agencies need to raise the following amounts during the last three months of 1981: Inter*Im, $23,750; International District Community Health Clinic, $70,000 to $100,000; Asian Counseling and Referral Service (ACRS), $60,000; Denise Louie Childcare Center, $20,000; CISC, $20,000; IDIC, $10,000; International Examiner $7,500.


Al Kurimura, International District manager, remarked, ""I don't know what good the housing that we got for the District is if we don't have the services to go along with it. That's the bottom line.""


Bob Santos, Inter*Im director, said glumly, ""I just hope we don't have to close our doors."" Inter*Im, which receives all its operational funds from CSA, coordinates the widely touted community garden, a meal voucher program for the elderly and the community food-buying co-op.


Don Wright, local CSA official, said, ""I don't see how agencies like Inter*Im can survive without a federal mandate, a national law to say that it is the policy of the United States government to address the paradox of poverty in the midst of wealth and plenty.""


The Economic Opportunity -- Act expires at the end of September and, according to critics of the Reagan administration, Reagan endeavors to kill the federal commitment to the war on poverty by not seeking reauthorization of the Act.


The Examiner has learned, however, that Democratic Congressman Ike Andrews of North Carolina will introduce, within the next two weeks, legislation to reauthorize the Economic Opportunity Act for another three years. ""We're going to rewrite the Act so that it's a good, sound bill from a technical standpoint,"" a House aide told The Examiner. ""The minority side (Republicans) would like to have a one-year reauthorization."" When testimony on the reauthorization begins in early April, the House source said, ""CSA will probably be the most controversial issue.""


If Congress decides to renew the Act, committees of the House and Senate would have to recommend appropriation of funds to CSA.


According to a source on the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health, Human Services and Education, ""no one on our committee has taken a public position on CSA yet. We just got the proposal (from Reagan). I really can't tell you whether the proposal will pass or not. Some members of the committee will support it and I'm sure some will oppose it.""


The House subommittee was scheduled to hold public hearings on CSA funding March 16 and 17. Santos said Inter*Im ""will be lobbying like crazy"" to get Congress to continue CSA.


Meanwhile, Kurimura, in a memorandum to the Mayor's Office, asked how the City could help ease the impact of the impending cutbacks in federal funding to the ID.


Kurimura noted that City block grant money provides less than 25 per cent of the combined budgets of the International District social service agencies facing the cutbacks. It is not expected that ID agencies will receive much additional help from the City, given the ceiling of 20 per cent of total block grant funds going to public services. Says Bill Stafford, director of inter-governmental relations for the City. ""There's not some golden pot down in City Hall to make up for the hundreds of millions of dollars that are going to be lost from the federal government. The reality is that a lot of programs are going to have to go.""


According to the City's Community Block Grant policy plan, ""there may be no alternative to cutting back or eliminating Community Development block grant support for some existing programs. For that reason, we cannot encourage submission of proposals for new service projects.


""If CETA support ends, the Community Development Block Grant program will not be able to pick up all previously funded CETA positions, but will consider those positions essential to project survival.""


International District social service agencies have turned their sights to United Way, with mixed success. ACRS and CISC are currently receiving United Way funds. The Denise Louie Child Care Center is an unsuccessful applicant. And the Health Clinic awaits word on a $50,000 request; the decision is not expected to be announced until late summer.


CISC Director Rita Wang is worried, though, that United Way funding won't be able to adequately make up for loss of CETA and CSA funds. Another drawback to United Way funding, says Wang, is that other private sector funding sources are closed off to United Way agencies.


Over at the Asian Counseling and Referral Service. Director Dave Okimoto summarizes his organization's financial condition tersely. ""It looks bad."" He's particularly worried about a loss of funds to provide mental health services for Indochinese. ""At some point in the future,"" he says. ""I think you won't be seeing funding to deal with preventative kinds of programs or programs to deal with the mildly ill.""


Gail Tanaka, who has been director of the Health Clinic for barely four months, now faces the mammoth task of planning the financial future of a clinic which is expected to receive significant cuts in federal funds and will probably lose the key back-up support of the Public Health Service Hospital, which the Reagan administration has slated for closure. She also noted that the Clinic will lose, at the end of September, a CETA position filled by a critical family health worker who covered two Laotian languages.


Rita Wang said CISC will lose four CETA positions, which may even terminate before the end of September. ""Our CETA staff are worried to death,"" Wang said. ""Every day, they're out looking for jobs.


""Knowing my staff, I know the service level will be kept as much the same as possible, but everyone will have to work extra loads. I and the office manager would have to be direct service workers again.""


The scrapping of CETA public service jobs also throws the Denise Louie Child Care Center into a predicament: where to find sufficient replacement money to support enough staff so the Center doesn't run afoul the state licensing law requiring a ratio of one teacher to every 10 students. The bilingual, bicultural childcare center, which currently ministers to 16 children, is relocating to Bailey Gatzert School later this month.


Both the International Drop-In Center and the International Examiner are losing valuable CETA positions at the end of September, uncertain where they can prospect for replacement money. The Exammer, operated as a non-profit community service, has two CETA employees who direct a volunteer staff which produces the monthly newspaper. The Examiner recently submitted an application for funding to the Campaign For Human Development.


Doug Chin, ID housing activist who now works with the City's Office of Policy Evaluation, said, ""Reagan's strategy is to cut the budget and give the localities responsibility for administering funds. But the localities don't want the responsibility unless they have more money.""


Reagan's proposal to eliminate CSA is coupled with a proposal to transfer 75 per cent of the 1981 service level funds to the states for allocation as part of a block grant for social services. The social services block grant is one of four consolidated block grants, under the Reagan proposal.


Ruthann Kurose, legislative aide to Congressman Mike Lowry, echoed the fear of other social service proponents for the International District: ""There's nothing to say that (Governor John) Spellman, when he gets the bucks, won't do what he wants with the money and set different priorities. It's always been the federal father that has looked out for us.


""It the consolidated block grant has to go through the state legislative committee process, it's a whole new ballgame.""


According to one source in the U.S. House of Representatives, ""there will be a very complicated formula for distributing the consolidated block grants. The administration hasn't given us enough information on specifics yet, but the whole idea is state control at this point.


""The money is being given the states with no strings attached. I think there will be pressure from the House to provide specifics.


""Also, remember that with 25 per cent of the funds cut off, someone is not going to get money.""


Liz Dunbar, executive director of the Washington State Commission on Asian American Affairs, said the level of awareness of the International District and Asians among State legislators is ""zero."" The most effective strategy, she said, will be for ID advocates to work in larger coalition with advocates of funding for mental health, welfare and education programs.


Said Kurose, ""We may be able to salvage something. The groups with a certain amount of political savvy -- they may be able to salvage some crumbs.""

International District agencies which receive funding under the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) have been informed that federal funding cuts will force an end to CETA public service jobs, effective the middle of this month.


The CETA program, which provides funding for staff positions in many key. International District social service agencies, had been slated for elimination at the end of September. However the Reagan administration has hastened the shutdown of CETA by reducing the program funds by 40 per cent retroactive to October 1, 1980.


The Reagan administration's conservative economic program calls for a major diversion of funds from social need programs to programs for the military. The scrapping of the 200,000 CETA public service jobs is coupled with a Reagan proposal to replace major categorical federal programs with locally-administered block grants. According to the administration proposal, the federal programs would be lumped into four consolidated block grants -- preventative health services, health services, social services, and energy and emergency assistance -- to be administered by the states and funded at 75 per cent of the 1981 service level.


The International District Improvement Association (Inter*Im) and -- to a lesser extent -- the Chinese Information and Service Center (CISC) rely on funding from the Community Services Administration (CSA), which the Reagan administration is seeking to abolish. The Economic Opportunity Act, which provides a federal mandate for the existence of the Community Services. Administration, expires at the end of September.


CISC, which is a United Way agency, also recently lost four CETA positions. Other agencies stricken by CETA cuts include: the Denise Louie Childcare Center, International Drop-In Center, Asian Counseling and Referral Service, and International District Community Health Clinic.


There is almost no prospect that the U.S. Congress will restore CETA funds; and the announcement that the funds would cease in May was greeted as an inevitability, although the cuts leave the Childcare Center and the Drop-In Center the most short-handed.


Reagan's consolidated block grant proposal has become the centerpiece of the battle over reduced spending levels for community social service agencies.


Like Inter*Im and CISC, the Health Clinic relies on federal money which, under Reagan's proposal, would be replaced with the block grant for health services, to be administered by the State.


Bill Hobson, director of the Central Seattle Community Health Centers, said that the states -- including Washington -- have had a poor track record in providing primary health care programs for the urban poor. ""The states may decide to fund local and state health departments rather than these primary health services,"" Hobson said. ""We can't expect anything good to happen at the state level."" He added that the State Department of Social and Health Services, which would be charged with administering the health services block grant under the Reagan proposal, is only ""in the beginning stages"" of formulating a mechanism for allocating the health services funds.


Curiously, although Reagan has released a draft of the proposal for the consolidated block grants, no legislation has yet been introduced in either house of Congress providing for implementation of the program.


Meanwhile, a House committee earlier this month, by a surprising vote of 24 to 8, reported out of committee a bill to reauthorize the Economic Opportunity Act for another three years. The full House is not expected to vote on the reauthorization until sometime this summer, according to one committee aide.


In another surprising move, the House Judiciary Committee approved a bill to fund the Legal Services Corporation for $260 million. The Reagan administration has called for the abolishment of Legal Services. According to a House aide, who asked not to be identified, the bill was a compromise measure receiving bipartisan support. The Senate Judiciary Committee had earlier voted approval for a bill to reauthorize and provide Legal Services with $100 million.


According to the House source, the House version ""adds language to enable the board of Legal Services to interpret guidelines on the bringing of class action suits initiated by Legal Services."" Opponents of Legal Services have criticized the agency for initiating class action lawsuits. The board, which would be comprised of 11 members appointed by Reagan, would presumably set the guidelines for Legal Services, according to the House source.


Inter*Im Director Bob Santos had earlier told The Examiner that if Legal Services were abolished, his agency would lose access to three attorneys who provide assistance with economic development, housing and land use planning. ""The District would be losing a great deal of assistance that can't be duplicated by any public or private agency,"" he said.


Inter*Im, which receives all its operational funds from CSA, will be asking for pledges from community businesses as a match for possible foundation money. ""If the community feels we're needed, then we hope they will want to contribute to keep this going."" he said.

""A total of 48 buildings, resulting from expected Downtown development, will replace 950,000 square feet of existing space, or 1,875 Apartment or hotel units....""


""OPE study, March 81""


In August 1980, the Seattle City Council passed the nation's first Housing. Preservation Ordinance (HPO) which was aimed at preserving the scarce and precious affordable housing, particularly in areas most vulnerable to demolitions of housing to make way for the kind of development projected above. Less than a year into operation; there is a move underway to scuttle the ""heart"" out of the ordinance.


What is the HPO and how does it work?


The law requires any developer who wishes to tear down structurally sound housing to pay a sliding fee unless he or she builds replacement housing. There is no fee if the developer decides instead to move the housing to another site. A relocation payment of $1,000 per tenant is also required by the new law. A few cases have arisen in which small business or home owners found the fee prohibitive. Most of these cases have arisen in single-family homes and in lower density areas (downtown neighborhoods such as the International District are in high density areas). Councilmember Michael Hildt has proposed Several amendments to the HPO one of which would exempt duplexes or single family homes of two or less. However, Councilmembers George Benson and Dolores Sibonga have something else in mind. They would like to wipe out the fee clause entirely and increase the relocation fee from $1,000 to $2,000. This would essentially gut the heart out of the ordinance. Many individuals are concerned about Hildt's proposed exemption of single family homes because over half of all demolitions occurring in 1977 and 1978 were either single family homes or housing in non-residential zones. But in the face of the Benson/Sibonga amendment, we of course cannot support wiping out the fee structure altogether.


Why are the fees necessary?


The sliding fee is the ""meat"" of the ordinance. Without it, demolition of low and moderate income housing continues at a time when even the City acknowledges that over 35,000 households are in need of housing financial assistance and that only 4 percent of the housing need are being met by public and private efforts.


The real issue is, do residents who live in neighborhoods have the right to stay in the face of bulldozers that would rather have a 60 floor office building? Does the City have the responsibility to intervene in this situation to ensure that this city remains ""livable"" for all income and age levels? Of course the answer is yes. Without public policy such as the HPO, affordable housing will not be preserved.


Having established the need for such a public law, the next question is -- has the HPO worked? Is the law a viable one and not the concoction of a few activists who managed to persuade five Councilmembers ""off guard"" to vote for the HPO back in August, 1980?


The HPO has only been in operation for nine months and is ""in need of some repair,"" according to Hildt. Of course it is too soon to assess its full merits without at least a trial period of a couple of years. But early figures show that the HPO is affecting demolitions in this city. An average of 23 demolitions were occurring prior to the HPO's passage with only an average of 14 demolitions per month after its passage. Moreover, the HPO just hasn't had the chilling effect developers feared of driving them out of the city to build elsewhere. Multi-family new construction or conversions averaged 207 per month after the HPO's passage and 188 per month prior to its passage! Early figures from Councilmember Hildt's office indicates less than a 10 percent reduction in total building permits from 1979 to 1980 and less than a 1 percent difference in commercial construction and multi-family construction respectively. There was a decrease in single family construction (down from 37 average to 14 average per month) after the HPO.


It is hoped that Hildt's amendment will address this problem. While certainly these figures cannot be totally conclusive, has the ordinance had such a dramatic negative impact to warrant a repeal with less than nine months into its operation?


Certainly the HPO cannot be seen in isolation: from inflation (with elderly paying 30-50 percent of incomes for rent) to the impact of high interest rates (or solely depending upon the private industry to build affordable housing and the Reagan game plan to cut housing financing and federal subsidy programs). While real estate industry spokespersons lament, ""we have too much regulation and red tape on us! First they wanted a just cause eviction protection law then the HPO, and what next?"" Typical scare tactics. Quite simple, we must protect our livability in the absence of federal and state support thanks to the new Republican administration.


Increasingly, local city government must take the lead in ensuring our city continues on a path of sane planning to keep our elderly living in the neighborhoods where they belong. If the big real estate industry has its own way, as it has had for decades, there will be no tomorrow.

The United States is assuaging its guit for involvement in the Vietnam war by bending over backwards to assist Asian refugees, and Leslie Yanover, a Vietnam-era veteran.


Yanover and other Vietnam-era veterans attended a city block grant preliminary meeting to support funding for the Seattle Veterans Action Center (SEA-VAC).


The City's Office of Policy and Evaluation (OPE) held an all-day meeting on July 7, 1981, at the Federal Building. The meeting was held to inform the community about the 1982 preliminary recommendations for block grant funding; and it was also an opportunity for the community to comment on those recommendations and to request funding. Over 40 participants, representing different interests and service agencies, attended.


SEA-VAC requested $125,000 and OPE recommended $40,000 funding. SEA-VAC provides employment services, counseling, discharge paper changes, and support advocacy for veterans. Not currently funded by city block grant money, SEA-VAC has been funded by the Veteran's Administration (VA) in previous years. But because of the cutbacks of the Reagan administration, the VA will end its support next year.


When the lower funding level for SEA-VAC was announced, irate supporters spoke up and a heated discussion ensued. Veterans claimed they were being discriminated against, citing how agencies serving mainly Asian refugees were getting more money than SEA-VAC which serves American citizens. They said it was no way to show appreciation to veterans who had served the United States. Referring to the Employment Opportunity Center (EOC) which serves many Asian refugees, one veteran said the could not understand how a refugee program could be funded at $130,000 and SEA-VAC only funded at $40,000. He said he did not know of any unemployed or unassisted refugee, but that he knew a lot of unemployed veterans.


Jackie Lum, OPE program coordinator, stated: ""The meeting was not for answering any societal wrongs or to change funding levels. The purpose of block money is to help specific areas of Seattle, specific kinds of services, and specific kinds of people. In particular, the purpose of city block grant money is for physical improvement, such as sidewalks and tree plantings for concentrated areas of the city. It can be used to fund social services that complement neighborhood improvement such as building up an area's employment, income and physical neighborhood. In this particular case, some of the persons served by SEA-VAC are not residents of Seattle.""


The Examiner spoke with two veterans who had attended the meeting to see if this was a case of racial prejudice against Asian refugees. But Leslie Yanover, interviewed two months later, reflected, ""We merely seized on the meeting as an outlet for our frustrations and anger."" Refugees are ""driving new cars, getting new homes, and have government assistance while veterans are not given such ""exceptional treatment,"" he said.


Asked whether SEA-VAC's priority service is counseling, Yanover said ""Personally, I feel that Vietnam veterans cannot get too much counseling."" He said a lot of veterans needed counseling before they went into the military and a lot more needed it after they got out. ""SEA-VAC,"" he said, ""deals with small groups of people and thus deals more effectively."" Besides counseling services, Yanover said SEA-VAC has job listings and placement services, can change discharge papers if they are faulty, and offers peer support.


""We are people just like others,"" said Steve Early, who spent three years in the Marine Corps, eight months of which were spent in South Vietnam. ""We did what we were told. At the time, we believed we were doing what our government felt was right, and that it was something that would benefit the people of South Vietnam.""


During his first 48 hours as a civilian. Early encountered his first experience with prejudice. Boarding an airplane to his hometown, he asked a passenger sitting in his seat to move. The passenger looked his uniform over, refused to sit by him, and left -- calling him a ""baby"" killer and spitting on him.


""We came back and expected to be accepted, but we weren't,"" he said. ""I was 22 years old and this was the first time I had ever experienced prejudice. It really shocked me. (When I returned home) I was treated as some sort of despicable animal.


""War is hell, but you can't change what's already happened.


Refugees from Asian countries have been given assistance that ""I have been denied,"" said Early. He emphasized that his feelings of resentment are not racially motivated, but stem from the fact that ""some people are treated with greater deference than others.""


Both Early and Yanover have experienced the prejudice of people who are anti-Vietnam-era-veterans, and have felt the hurt and bewilderment of returning home from doing what they believed to be their duty for their country. They feel their experienced and feelings are typical of Vietnam-era veterans. They represent the lucky few who have managed to cope and adjust.

As everyone knows by now, we are being governed by a social-economic political system which has been commonly referred to as ""Reaganomics."" The budget cuts we have heard about in the news are taking place. As we ponder the wisdom of the cuts, the Reagan Administration has assured us that the cuts which have created massive holes in federal social service programs will not affect the ""truly needy.""


But who are the ""truly needy?"" I have yet to see or hear the Administration identify who these incredibly helpless people are. How bad off are the ""truly needy?"" How does one qualify to be ""truly need.""


Is it handicapped people? No, I don't think so. The budget cuts have included money which had been earmarked for the education of handicapped people. The Reagan. Administration has also indicated that it will push for legislation easing regulations which have protected the rights of handicapped people.


Is it children? No, I don't think so. The budget cuts have included money which had been earmarked for education in the elementary and secondary area. The cuts which were made have created a ""ripple"" effect on state funding for education. Witness the ten percent across the board state funding cut announced recently by Washington State Governor John Spellman.


Is it the hungry? No. I don't think so. The budget cuts have included money earmarked for the Food Stamp program. The Food Stamp program, has been rocked with massive rip-offs by people who have taken advantage of the loopholes in the administration of the system. Can it be argued that people who were ""truly hungry"" took advantage of the program? Rather than tightening up the administration of the program, the Administration has cut money for the program and has tightened eligibility requirements. This may insure that hungry people won't take advantage of the program, but it won't insure that greedy grocers or underworld organizations are not going to still find their share.


Is it hungry children? No, I don't think so. The budget cuts have included money for school lunch programs. Not only are school lunches going to cost more but there will be less food for children to eat. In an effort to lessen the effect of cuts on hungry school children, the Federal Department of Agriculture has redefined the nutritional requirements for school lunches. Instead of 8 ounces of milk, 6 ounces of milk is appropriate. In an effort to lessen the effects caused by increasing costs of fruits and vegetables, the Department of Agriculture had redefined ""fruits and vegetables"" to include ketchup and relish. After an uproar, Reagan rescinded the redefinition of fruits and vegetables.


Is it people who can't afford lawyers? No, I don't think so. The budget cuts have included money which had been earmarked to go to the Legal Services Corporation. Legal Services was a program created by the Democrats to ensure that people, no matter what their income, would have access to legal services. For many years, poor people could not exercise their rights because they could not afford lawyers. Because of Legal Services (which is often called Legal Aid), poor people could defend their rights without being taken advantage of because they could not afford a lawyer. Massive cuts in the Legal Services Program have resulted in the layoff of lawyers and the closing of offices. Less people will be served.


Is it the sick? No, I don't think so. The budget cuts included money earmarked for community health centers and public health hospitals. Although health centers and public health hospitals were not totally eliminated, cuts in funding will affect the ability to provide health care, the number of people served, and the ability of state and local government to maintain what services are available.


Is it the unemployed? No, I don't think so. Elimination of the Comprehensive Employment and Training Program, also referred to as CETA, ended the government's job training program for unemployed people. The rationale for the elimination of the program is that the private sector would pick up the slack and hire the unemployed. The Reagan Administration also proposed the elimination of the Extended Unemployment Compensation Program under which the Federal Government provided a source for unemployment compensation benefits in areas which had high rates of unemployment for a period which added on to state unemployment programs. Finally, the Federal government funding for many state and local job training and job search programs was also cut.


Is it the aged? It might be but I don't think so. Pension funds have been reduced. Social Security cuts have been proposed, although for the time being rejected. Senior services have been either eliminated or cut back. Federal retirement pensions have been cut back. There was a proposal for a delay in granting cost of living increases in many fund programs benefiting the elderly.


So if it isn't the handicapped, the children, the hungry, people who can't afford lawyers, the sick and the disabled, the unemployed, or the aged, who are the ""truly needy?""


Defense contractors? Tobacco farmers? The wealthy? Or did Reagan really mean to say the ""truly greedy?"" No, I refuse to believe that. What I really think is that there is no definition for the ""truly needy."" The ""truly needy"" make themselves known.


So, Ronnie, tell us who the ""truly needy are?"" Give us a sign that you really aren't cutting everybody off. When you are going to have a lottery to determine the ""truly needy"" family of America? When are you going to present the ""truly needy"" person at a White House press conference so we can gawk and stare? When are we going to be able to take a ""truly needy"" person to lunch? When is ""National Truly Needy Week?""


All callousness aside, I would have a better understanding of the Reagan budget cuts if I knew what his definition of the ""truly needy"" is. But I don't think there is any. Any day I can expect Reagan to announce that there was a War on Poverty, and guess what, we won. Se let's pull out from this war.


In truth, Reagan is developing my definition of who the ""truly needy"" are. It's everybody who lost something through the budget cuts. During the French Revolution. Marie Antoinette said in response to the pleas of the starving poor. ""Let them eat cake."" With all the money going to defense, the Reagan Administration appears to be saying to those people who have lost through his cuts, ""Let them bite the bullet.""


So if anybody asks you, ""Who are the truly needy?"" you can say, ""I don't know, but there seems to be a whole lot of us around.""

Social Security does not have a problem serious enough to warrant the magnitude of cuts proposed, stated Joe Dear, assistant research director for the Washington State Labor Council, AFL-CIO. He said the Reagan administration is proposing to reduce Social Security benefits by $82 billion to solve an $11 billion Social Security problem. Social Security does have a problem, said Dear but it can be solved in a less severe way.


Dear was one of the panelists participating in the two-day conference ""Social Security; Questions for Your Future, held September 22 to 23, at the University of Washington.


Robert Dunn, assistant regional commissioner with the Social Security Administration, presented a brief history of Social Security. Old people who retired and did not have savings or pensions, he said, either depended on their children for support or went to the ""poor farms."" But the Depression wiped out savings and younger people's jobs, and the problem of care for the elderly became tremendous. Thus, in 1935, President Franklin D. Roosevelt pushed to create the Social Security System.


Social Security was originally intended to replace part of a retiree's lost earnings. Supposedly, Dunn said, retirees would have another pension and/or savings. Because workers paid into the system through their payroll taxes, workers had an earned right to draw a pension. However. Dunn emphasized, it is not an individual's personal and private retirement account nor is it an insurance policy. The cash that goes in today, goes right back out to pay for current retiree benefits. In setting up the original Social Security System, the government looked towards the future, recognized that the payroll tax might become too heavy, and recommended eventual general tax revenue funding.


Social Security faces two problems. The short-term problem is the shortage of actual cash to pay for benefits and could occur in the fall of 1982. The long-term problem could occur in 30 years when the baby-boom generation begins to retire. Because of the low-birthrate trend, and the increased longevity and large number of retirees projected in 30 years, there will be fewer workers paying into the system and more people taking out benefits for longer periods of time.


When he first started working for Social Security in the 1960's, Dunn said the policy was to encourage early retirement to create more job openings for younger workers. Now, policy changes in areas such as disability try to encourage people to retire later.


Today, 36 million people receive Social Security every month, stated Dunn. The yearly budget is $130 billion. Nine out of 10 working people contribute to Social Security and one out of seven people are receiving Social Security benefits. In 1937 employees paid one percent of their wages, matched by employer contributions, up to a wage base of $3,000. The maximum payment was $30. Today, employees pay 6.65 percent of their wages, mathced by employer contributions, up to a wage base of $29,700. The maximum payment can be $1,975.05. The wage base is the annual gross wages of an employee up to a certain amount which can be taxed by Social Security.


Since its inception, the Social Security System has been dependent on the economy's performance. Its tax rates and wage bases have been calculated on the assumption that wages would increase faster than prices. The wage bases on which taxes are levied have been periodically adjusted to a wage index, and benefit increases have been periodically adjusted to the Consumer Price Index (CPI). When prices rose faster than wages in the 1970's, benefits, based on the CIP (prices), outstripped the tax payments, which were based on a lower wage index. Because payroll taxes coming in were less than the benefit payments going out, reserves in the OASI had to be used and are now so low that by the fall of 1982, they could be depleted.


Besides inflation, other causes of the short-term problem include unemployment, more early retirees and increased longevity, and off-target estimates made in the past.


The ""umbrella"" of Social Security grew as new benefits and increased coverage were added on in later years. Now, Dunn, said, Social Security benefits include pensions, support for survivors, Medicare, and disability payments.


The long-term problem will result in the next century when, it is projected, the number of beneficiaries far exceeds the number of workers. Also, projected expenditures are expected to exceed revenue in the Social Security trust funds. Currently, there are three workers to every retiree in the system; but it is projected that, in 2010, there will be two workers to every retiree in the system. The working group will have to pay higher taxes in order to maintain present level benefits, plus the cost of these benefits is expected to rise.


Tax and benefit projections are made by ""making specific assumptions about a very large number of future conditions that are basically unknowable even a year or two ahead,"" explained Worcester ""Law requires projections 75 years into the future.""


Conference speakers and panelists all agreed that the government is making Social Security's financial problem into a political problem.


Social Security's budget is a budget with a specific amount of money dedicated for specific expenditure, stated Ken Cameron, Human Services consultant. However, it is incorporated into the federal budget when the government makes a public presentation of the budget. Its political use is not a realistic picture of the government budget.


Because the ""umbrella"" of Social Security has adopted some ""welfare"" elements in its benefits, its policies have become unclear. Professor Edgar Borgatta Director of the University of Washington's Institute on Aging, stated that basic value questions must be answered: Is Social Security an entitlement or welfare program, or something in between? Only after this is answered, can a policy be adopted to relate benefits to the value of the dollar, how much can be spent, and how much taxation is possible. The Reagan administration has not tackled the question -- How might the system itself be changed? Until this question is dealt with, he said, all possible alternatives to the question will not have been examined.

So, you were laid off from your job because it was necessary to save the economy. You can't find a job because everybody you know in the same line of work was laid off, too. You're unemployed and you don't know what to do. It's time to be creative and look toward the private sector. Invent your own line of work.


You can take up the profession of waiting line for other people. These days, people are on the go and can't afford to wait in line for anything. But do you realize how many lines people have to wait in? There are lines for football games, rock concerts, student registration, grocery shopping airline tickets, and, of course, unemployment. People don't have time to wait in these lines. But you do. You have lots of time on your hands. Offer to wait in line for other people in exchange for pay. Charge by the hour.


Get a group of your unemployed colleagues together and become a professional crowd. There's money to be made in being part of a crowd. Lots of events need crowds -- demonstrations, sidewalk musicians, bad movies, politicians. Do you realize that events need publicity so that non-professional crowds will come? Do you realize that the media won't cover anything unless there are more than 10 people? Offer a package deal -- you will provide the crowd and coordinate the media package. Charge by the event.


Write your life story. However, if you lead a boring life, you had better make things up. Or get adopted and write about the horrible things your mother did to you. Charge by the chapter.


Invent something. After all, someone invented the hula hoop. Inventions are a good way to go to make money. The problem is coming up with an idea. Build a better mousetrap. Reinvent the wheel. Discover the cure for the common cold. The possibilities are endless. Charge by the gimmick.


Run for political office. Ronald Reagan was an-out-of-work movie actor when he ran for Governor of California. Richard Nixon had struck out as a hot dog vendor when he ran for Congress. And the both became President. Charge by the vote.


Become a rock star Remember those days in the office when your job got to you and you wanted to scream your head off. Why not get paid for it? All it takes is a bass player, a guitar player, and a drummer and you're in business. Musical training is not necessary. Charge by the decibel.


How about being a professional dogooder? Do you knew that billionaires, politicians, budget cutters, and oil executives really would like to do something nice for people if they only had the time? Well, you have the time and they have the guilt. You can go around helping old ladies across the street in the name of Howard Hughes. Sure he's dead. But a person that rich had to have a lot of guilt left over. Charge by the good deed of the day.


Start your own religion. Others have done it and have done quite well financially. Where would Jim Jones and Sun Myung Moon be without their own religion? And that's just the start. After you get your own religion started, you can open your own chain of convenience stores. All it takes is a lot of faith and little inspiration Charge by the prayer.


All these pursuits require very little experience, very little education, and, in many cases, very little brains. All you need is a lot of charisma, a little ingenuity, and the gullibility of the American public. That's what's called private enterprise. It's what made America great.

""If you close the hospital, it would force me to go to private doctors and hospitals that I cannot afford. We all know how expensive medical care, hospitals, medicines, and blood tests can get. It doesn't take long to spend all your savings with one hospitalization. Please help keep Public Health Service Hospital open for poeple like me.""


--Testimony by an International District Community Health Center patient before Congressional hearings on closure of the PHS Hospital.


The fight to keep the Public Health Service (PHS) Hospital open for community clinic patients, like the patient quoted above, began 10 months ago when the Reagan Administration identified closure of the Hospital as one of the necessary budget cutbacks. For the 40,000 to 60,000 patients served by the community clinic system in King County, the PHS Hospital is the only source of specialty care and hospitalization they can afford. In addition to these low-income patients who would be most severely affected by the cutback, the 24,000 Hospital beneficiaries entitled to care under the PHS system would have to find alternative sources for medical care if the hospital were closed.


When the federal cut proved inevitable, local community, health and political forces drew up a plan to continue operation of the hospital under local control, recognizing the disasterous effects closure of the PHS Hospital would have, not only on the community health care system, but on the entire King County health care system. After 10 months of planning, letter writing, negotiating, public testimony, financial analysis, and several scares, it appears the local Public Health Hospital Preservation and Development Authority (PHHPDA) will keep the hospital open.


With the assistance of the Washington State Congressional delegation, particularly Senator Slade Gorton and Representative Norm Dicks, the Public Health Hospital Preservation and Development Authority (PHHPDA) and the Reagan Administration have reached an agreement in principle on the transfer of the Seattle Public Health Service Hospital to the PHHPDA. Under the agreement, the Administration will seek an appropriation of $26 million for the PHHPDA. The Hospital will be transferred on November 20, 1981, or as soon thereafter as practically is possible. Congressional action is required on the requested appropriation and possibly a few other aspects which cannot be resolved administratively.


The $26 million appropriation will help bring the hospital building up to local code requirements and finance operations of the hospital in the transition period before it can become self supporting.


Now that the closure of the Hospital has been prevented, the issue before the PHHPDA and the community clinics is how much free or discounted care will be available to the community. Bruce Miyahara, PHHPDA Board member, stated that he is optimistic about the Hospital's future and feels it will be able to continue its mission and commitment to provide care for community clinic patients. The PHHPDA is currently writing up a memorandum of agreement with the community clinics which would continue the services the Hospital provides for the clinics and clinic patients. A discount schedule is also included in these negotiations to ensure that services will remain affordable.


While the cooperation and commitment between the Hospital and clinics plays an important part in providing health services for the under-served population in King County, in light of other federal, state and local budget cuts, the efforts of these two groups will not be sufficient to meet the growing health needs of the area. To become self supporting, the Hospital will have to achieve a balance of paying and non-paying patients. Harborview, which changed from a public county hospital to a University run self supporting hospital in 1967, has recognized its limited ability to provide discounted care. Other hospitals have fulfilled their obligations to provide free care under the Hill-Burton program in the first few months of the year.


At a time when patients are losing their ability to pay for health care due to losses in Medicaid coverage, unemployment and the need to spend discretionary income for food and shelter, the PHS Hospital and the community clinics (which are also suffering from cutbacks) will not be able to be a ""safety net"" for all the people in need. The ramifications of all the cuts must be spread over a much larger base in the health care community to keep ""economic recovery"" from turning into the medical demise of King County.

It was a cold december morning as Ebenezer Reagan put on his coat and scart to face the bitter winter winds sweeping over the country. As he took his morning stroll, he marvelled at the crowds of people walking past him, scurrying to and from department stores in search of goodies for their loved ones. He paused to watch department store Santas bouncing little children on their knees while bright neon signs flashed on and off. ""How can these people do this?"" he wondered. ""Why, it almost seems like they are enjoying themselves.""


""These people don't know what's going on,"" he thought to himself. ""Don't they know about inflation? Don't they know that all this spending for Christmas is sure to increase the interest rate? Why, it's defeating my national economic recovery plan. They're buying socks and shirts and microwaves when they should be investing in steel mills, utilities, and nuclear power plants. They're buying toys rather than investing in the real thing. After all, why buy toy boats when you can invest in a nuclear submarine?"" Ebenezer felt it was time to take action. He picked up his pace and ran back to his white house.


Once back at the office, Ebenezer picked up his phone to call his workers together. Armed with scissors, his loyal staff responded. ""Cut the budget!"" Ebenezer yelled. ""It's tob fat!"" And his staff worked hard, long hours into the night. Ebenezer was tired. But at last, he was finished. ""This will teach the people,"" he felt. And the budget was ready, lean and hungry, except for one noticeable bulge, Ebenezer looked at the bulge. Inside the bulge were guns, missile launchers, tanks, neutron bombs, and army men. ""Why deal with imitations when I can give the people the real thing,"" Ebenezer thought. He was proud of himself. He would show the budget to some of the people who worked under him.


He walked to the house of Bob Democrachit. The Democratchits were all in the house. Ebenezer wanted to show his budget to the Democratchits because they didn't like the way he was running things. He gave them his budget and they looked it over.


A small voice spoke up. ""What is in that budget for the people?"" the voice asked. It was Tiny Tip, the spiritual leader of the Democratchits.


Ebenezer replied. ""Lower interest rates and a strong defense.""


""How about food for the people?"" Tiny Tip asked.


Ebenezer replied, ""Let them grow their own food.""


""How about decent health care for the people? Tiny Tip asked.


Ebenezer replied, ""Let them learn not to get sick.""


""What about jobs for people?"" Tiny Tip asked.


Ebenezer replied, ""Let them learn to be air controllers.""


Tiny Tip cried.


Ebenezer scolded him, ""It's Democratchits like you that have got us into the mess we are in.""


A week had passed. Ebenezer once again put on his coat and scart to face the bitter winter winds. He walked the empty streets on this cold Christmas Eve. He strolled past the deserted department stores where unemployed Santas stood outside their doors begging for pennies. The neon signs remained unplugged. ""Good,"" Ebenezer thought to himself. ""The people are conserving energy and since they are not buying anything, they must be investing. My plan is working."" He was tired. He decided that he had accomplished what he wanted to. He walked past an Asian storeowner putting an ""Out of Business"" sign on his store. Ebenezer paused to look at the storeowner. ""Bad management, no doubt,"" he thought. ""He's probably a victim of the free spending done by those Democratchits.""


Ebenezer walked into his white house. He felt sleepy so he decided to turn in. As soon as his head hit the pillow. Ebenezer was snoring. Little lambs crossed picket fences in his mind as he slept on. Suddenly, he sat up in bed awakened by a noise which he could not identify. It was a faint thud and clank sound, growing stronger, coming nearer. Ebenezer was a little scared, drawing his covers closer around him. The thud and clank drew nearer. A white haze permeated Ebenezer's bedroom. It slowly took shape. Ebenezer recognized the figure standing before his bed. The shoulders were hunched, the arms were outstretched with fingers on each hand pointing upward in a vee sign and a tape recorder was attached to his feet. It was his old California political partner, Jacob Milhaus. ""Ebenezer,"" Milhaus wheezed.


""I thought your political life was dead,"" Ebenezer cried.


""Ebenezer,"" Milhaus continued. An eighteen minute gap followed. Then Milhaus spoke up again. ""Ebenezer,"" he moaned, ""you cannot fool the people. You are making a big mistake if you think that you can. I should know, I was caught trying to slip some water under a gate. When the clock strikes the hour for three consecutive hours, you will be visited by the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present and Future."" The voice grew weaker. ""Ebenezer,"" the voice grew fainter, ""listen to what they say, go to where they go, and do as they command."" The voice was almost a whisper. ""I am not a crook.""


Ebenezer was alone in the room once again. He sat in his bed. ""Got to stop eating jelly beans,"" he thought. ""It's giving me some strange dreams."" He turned over on his side and, once again, drifted off to never-never land.


The clock in Ebenerer's room struck one. With a loud ""bong,"" Ebenezer woke up. He could feel an ice cold breeze against his face. He clutched his bed covers. A bright light glimmered, growing larger as it approached him. Ebenezer had to close his eyes. When he opened them, he was faced with the ghost of Herbert Hoover the Ghost of Christmas Past. ""I remember who you were,"" Ebenezer said to the figure standing before him. ""You were President of the United States during the Depression."" The ghostly figure beckoned Ebenezer to follow him.


Suddenly Ebenezer found himself at the back lot at MGM. He remembered his carefree days at the old movie studio. He looked around him. There were all of his old pals -- Joan Crawford Errol Flynn, Gary Cooper. He stopped and called to them. They didn't respond, they couldn't see him. A familiar face walked by him. He called out, ""Bonzo, don't you recognize me?"" But the chimpanzee kept walking, not conscious of Ebenezer. The Ghost of Christmas Past took Ebenezer by the hand and took him outside the lot.


Ebenezer walked with Ghost of Christmas Past, chatting to the silent figure that glided beside him. ""I remember those days, What fun everyone had. Movies were a dime in those days. Not like today."" Ebenezer rambled on but the Ghost did not respond. The Ghost took Ebenezer past the soup lines of unemployed people, the dry dust bowls of migrants travelling aimlessly, the ghettos and tenements of the poor, and the factories where children worked to support the family. But Ebenezer couldn't see what was before him. He rambled on about his glory days as a movie star.


The clock struck two. With two loud ""bongs,"" Ebenezer sat up in his bed, realizing he was in his old white house. ""Damn those jelly beans,"" he said. ""I've got to get some sleep."" A bright light glimmered, glowing stronger as it neared him. He shut his eyes. When he opened them, he was faced with the ghost of David Stockman, the Ghost of Christmas Present. ""I remember you,"" Ebenezer cried out. ""You were my budget director until you gave that interview to that magazine. Why are you the Ghost of Christmas Present when you have no future in my administration?"" Ebenezer asked. The ghost of David Stock man spoke up: ""It's a trojan horse. I didn't know what I was doing. I wanted to cut defense spending."" The ghost of Christmas Present beckoned him to come with him.


Ebenezer followed him. He followed him past the long unemployment lines, past the old people asking for medical aid, past the crowds of demonstrating people, past the union picket signs, past the crazies who needed help past the racists burning crosses, past the empty condominiums, past the starving babies, past the television preachers sermonizing against gun control. He told the Ghost of Christmas Present. ""It'll get better. Everyone will have a job. The private sector will take care of the old, the sick, and the young. Wait til the interest rate goes down."" But the Ghost of Christmas Present replied, ""It's a trojan horse.""


The clock struck three. With three loud ""bongs,"" Ebenezer once again sat up in bed. He saw the glowing light coming toward him. He had to shield his eyes. It was the Ghost of Christmas Future. Ebenezer recognized the figure standing before him Dressed in full battle dress, with medals shining, brass polished and swords drawn, it was the General. Alexander Haig. ""General,"" Ebenezer said, ""it looks like you're dressed for war."" The Ghost of Christmas Future did not respond. He beckoned Ebenezer to follow him. The Ghost of Christmas Future did an about face and began marching out toward the bedroom door. Fbenezer stepped in behind the General and started to follow him. The Ghost of Christmas Future stopped at the door and motioned Ebenezer to open it. Ebenezer opened the door.


Over at the house of the Democratchits. the folks there were opening what little presents they had. Tiny Tip looked at the barren Christmas tree. He whispered softly to himself, ""Merry Christmas, God help us every one and all.""

Below market rate loans from the federal government are still available for healthy, small businesses. Despite a downturn in the national and local economy, the International District continues to see an influx of new smaller businesses. In the last twelve months over 25 small businesses have opened in the ID. They include restanrants, groceries, jewelers, pharmacies, gift shops and professional medical and legal services.


In recent months, two international District businesses have taken advantage of the Small Business Administration (SBA) 503 loan program. Gilt Edge Cleaners has updated its equipment and Luke's Pharmacy has opened in the ID with the help of the SBA and City Development Division.


The 503 program provides loan funds for up to 40 percent of a fixed asset expansion or improvement project for a term of up to 25 years at a fixed, below-market interest rate. A commercial bank such as Rainier or Sea-First provides a loan for 50 percent of the project costs and the small business provides the balance of 10 percent. This program is attractive to banks because they only finance 50 percent of the project, but receive a first mortgage as security for their loan.


The City's Development Division has recently begun working with small businesses to assist them in preparing and processing 503 loan applications. Cindi Shiota, a loan specialist with the Division, is working with several Asian businesses on 503 loans.


The Mayor recognizes that small businesses are important to Seattle's economy both in terms of jobs and revenue,"" she says. ""The packaging of 503 loan applications is an example of the City's commitment to small businesses.""


Both Shiota and John Braden, another member of the Development Division staff, emphasized that the City does not compete with private financial institutions. In fact, a small businessperson must show that financing is not available through a private bank before the City will get involved in a 503 application. According to Braden, ""If a business is seeking a loan, they should first contact their personal banker."" If a business can not obtain necessary financing from their bank, they should contact the City. The City will work on behalf of the small business in preparing and presenting the loan application to the Small Business Administration.


""The SBA loan program is best suited for established small businesses that need financing for equipment, leasehold improvements or building and land acquisition,"" said Braden. Shiota added, ""The Chinatown-International District is targeted by the City for development assistance such as SBA loans.""


This past summer, Luke's Pharmacy, an institution on Capitol Hill, moved to the ID. Owners Hoover Mar, Jim Luke and Bertha Tsuchiya used a 503 loan to pay part of the cost of improvements in their International House location at Maynard Avenue and Weller Street.


""There is no parking on Capitol Hill and we felt the ID had a good future,"" said Luke in explaining the move after 28 years on Capitol Hill. Mar added, ""Our Chinese clientele has stayed with us and we see new faces each day.""


Zeno ""Nick"" Nicholson, owner-operator of Gilt Edge Cleaners, is also optimistic about the ID's future. ""Business will improve as buildings are repaired and people return to the ID to live. In fact, several of the residents in the rehabilitated Evergreen Apartments are new customers of mine;"" said Nick. ""People are also wearing more natural fabrics instead of polyesters which helps the cleaning business.""


Gilt Edge Cleaners received an SBA 503 loan to buy new cleaning equipment and make space improvements in the Evergreen Apartments building. ""I was fixing the equipment on the day-to-day basis and often had to special-order replacement parts,"" said Nick. ""It was getting very expensive and the machinery kept me from expanding my clientele.""


Both Braden and Shiota caution that the 503 loan application process is time consuming and can get expensive depending upon documents required by SBA and the condition of the small business's financial records. Both Nicholson and Jim Luke heartily agreed with this. ""If it wasn't for the City I would not have gotten a loan for my new equipment,"" said Nicholson. However, I did not realize how much paperwork and documentation was required.""


Jim Luke said, ""My advice to any businessperson thinking about getting a 503 loan is to find out from the beginning all that will be required in terms of required documentation and legal and loan placement fees. A business should also be able to continue during the one year or so of processing which seems to be required before the loan is approved."" Hoover Mar added, ""Make sure the City and SBA people know what they are talking about before you make any decisions.""


Commenting on the prospects of the 503 program, Shiota said, ""I understand that the Reagan administration supports the SBA 503 program and the new tax law provides incentives for business expansion such as accelerated depreciation and investment tax credits.""


Businesses interested in the SBA 503 loan program or other services offered by the Development Division of DCD should call either Cindi Shiota or John Braden at 625-4530.

The Republican controlled House Committee on Redistricting of the Washington State Legislature passed a bill to redistrict the state's congressional districts.


The bill, called Plan No. 9, would change the seventh Congressional District to encompass the southern half of Seattle, Mercer Island, Bellevue, Redmond, Kirkland, Bothell and Woodinville. The plan would also place Tacoma in a district that stretches south to include Vancouver. Wash. The bill died during the special session of the Legislature, but may be acted upon when the Legislature convenes for its regular session.


The Seventh District presently encompasses the southern half of Seattle and parts of Capitol Hill and the central area and Burien, Renton, Mercer Island, and part of Bellevue. The Seventh District is presently represented by Democrat Mike Lowry. Plan No. 9 would strongly favor Republican candidates. Voters in the suburban areas of the proposed district voted overwhelmingly for Ronald Reagan and Slade Gorton in the 1980 elections.


Plan No. 9 and Plans 1 and 10 were the subject of a public hearing in Olympia in early November. Republicans unveiled the three plans only minutes before the beginning of the hearing. The Republicans chose the three from over a dozen plans secretly prepared by the Republican staff. Democratic legislators on the committee complained about the lack of an opportunity to study the plans to have any role in the formation of the plans. The maps unveiled for public testimony were so small that it was not precisely clear which parts of the Puget Sound area were included in which district.


Under Plan No. 10, the Seventh District would include all of Seattle, except the very northern end, Tukwila, and parts of Renton and Burien. Mercer Island, where Lowry lives, would be placed into the Eighth Congressional District, comprised of strong Republican suburban and rural areas.


Among the persons testifying at the hearing was Gary Locke, attorney and president of Asian Americans for Political Action (AAPA). Locke testified in favor of Plan 10 as being the best of the three plans for preserving the voting interests of Asians and minorities. Locke said that under constitutional requirements, communities of interest must be preserved in any redistricting plan. The interests of inner-city Asians and minorities may not be diluted by placing those voters in a district of predominately suburban and lrural voters.


Locke said Plans No. 1 and 9 would dilute the voting interests of Asians and minorities. He told the committee that Asians and minorities live predominately in Seattle. Their concerns and socio-economic interests differ from those of the typical suburban and rural voter, he said. Locke said Asians and minorities do not want to compete among suburban and rural voters for the attention of their congressional representative.


Asked how he felt that Lowry would be living outside the Seventh District under Plan 10, Locke said whether Lowry remained the representative from the Seventh District was not the issue because AAPA is non-partisan. The issue, he said, was whether inner-city Asians and minorities are in a district comprised of voters with similar interests and concerns.


Also testifying in favor of plan 10 were Constance Rice for the King County Democrats and Lem Howell for Congressman Mike Lowry.

According to the 1980 census, there are over 30,000 Indochinese refugees residing in Washington State. Though hardly noticeable in numbers just 10 years ago, today they constitute one-third of the state's Asian population.


In the past, most Asian pioneers came to this country for economic reasons and to fill a demand for their labor. In contrast. Indochinese refugees, technically, have been invited to come to the U.S. by the federal government for political, not economic, reasons. Thus, they are entitled to receive special government services and aid. However, like earlier Asian immigrants, Indochinese refugees experience many hardships in physical and cultural adjustment, lack of employment opportunities, poor living conditions, and racism.


The following is an interview with Craig Shimabukuro community organization specialist with the Commission on Asian American Affair's Indochinese Refugee Project.


What accounts for the recent large infhux of Indochinese refugees into the state of Washington?


Craig: The reason why we have so many Indochinese refugees in Washington is directly tied to the federal government's foreign policy and past involvement in Southeast Asia. When the U.S. began its military withdrawal, it promised political asylum to Vietnamese Cambodian and Laotian government and military personnel who had been ""on our side,"" and to dependents of U.S. servicemen, and people who had worked with U.S. corporations. The U.S. government also assured ally countries, such as Thailand, where most of the refugee camps are located, that it would continue to bring out refugees.


What are some of the needs of Indochinese refugees when they arrive?


Craig: The goal of refugee resettlement is to help refugees become self-sufficient and self-supporting in this society as quickly as possible. In light of this goal, there are three main needs that Indochinese refugees have when they arrive here in Washington.


One is a good, overall orientation to U.S. society and culture. The refugees need to know that U.S. society stresses individualism and self-help and that this is also expected of them. They also need to be aware of what other people's attitudes towards them are and that people are becoming more hostile now that the job market is tightening up. Finally, they need to be oriented to daily living skills -- how to use a stove and other appliances, ride the bus, drive cars, etc.


Secondly, refugees need to know what services, including ESL (English As A Second Language) employment & job training, health and mental health services. The refugees are really under a lot of stress dealing with the lack of jobs, acculturation of the children, and general breakdown of the traditional family system. Mental health services are really important.


The third main need is help in community development. All Asian immigrant groups have had to form self-help groups in order to survive in this country. For instance, the Chinese had family associations, and the Japanese had kenjinkai and later JACL (Japanese American Citizens League). The Indochinese communities are no exception -- they also need to develop their own organizations to take care of social, cultural and welfare needs, and a number of Indochinese churches and Mutual Assistance Associations (MAAs) have already been formed. These groups need help in leadership training, organization and networking with other Asian and non-Asian community groups.


How are services for Indochinese refugees set up?


Craig: Services are provided on a funded and a non-funded, or volunteer basis.


On a funded basis, the state of Washington gets money from the federal government to provide services. This money is specifically earmarked for refugees and is separate from other Health and Human Services and Social Security Administration monies that are used to provide services for the rest of the population. This money goes to the Department of Social and Health Services which has set up the Bureau of Refugee Assistance to coordinate all the resettlement efforts, distribute cash and medical benefits and develop social service programs.


The Bureau of Refugee Assistance then subcontracts various state and private agencies to provide the services. For instance, the Bureau works with the Superintendent of Public Instruction to contract ESL classes and vocational training to community colleges and private institutions. It contracts employment services to the Department of Employment Security and to private, non-profit agencies like the Employment Opportunity Center and Catholic Charities.


Services are also provided on a volunteer basis. There are many volunteer agencies or what we call VOLAGs, that are active in providing these same services. VOLAGs are often church organizations and are directly paid $525 per refugee by the federal government, or are funded through their church organizations.


The other main volunteer organizations are the MAAs, which I just mentioned before. An MAA is basically any non-profit Indochinese organization that isn't a church. They vary in size, services, role and function in the community. Some focus on cultural programs, but most provide some type of volunteer services such as translations, transportation, counseling and emergency assistance.


Although Indochinese refugees have their own social services, and special funding from the federal government, aren't Indochinese also using many of the services in the Asian community? Does this conflict with the needs of other Asian groups?


Craig: It is true that Indochinese refugees are also using various services in the Asian community such as the I.D. Health Clinic, Asian Counseling and Referral Service and Chinese Information and Service Center. It is also true that this is putting a strain on these services. The Asian community just got these services in the last 10 years and they weren't adequate for our community's needs even then. Now, with a large influx of Indochinese who also need these services, they are under more of a strain. For instance, now there are longer waiting lines at the clinic, and precious staff slots have to be further subdivided to deal with another Asian group -- the Indochinese.


I know many people in the Asian community are upset that so much money and attention is being given to the refugees. Some Asians even have the attitude that ""In the past we didn't get this kind of help so why should they?"" I feel that this way of looking at things is completely wrong. It's competitive and it's pointing the finger at the victims, not the problem. The problem isn't that Indochinese refugees are getting more than other Asian groups, but that the U.S. government is not and has never taken adequate care of people's needs.


Are services for Indochinese refugees going to fall under the axe of Reagan's budget cuts? What are some alternatives to offset these cuts?


Craig: Reagan's cuts have been disastrous for Indochinese refugees. Social services have already been cut over 50 percent from last year to $2.5 million. Last year, $3 million was budgeted for ESL classes alone! This means that ESL instruction has to be cut from 900 to 450 hours. Can you imagine trying to learn enough English to get a job in only 450 hours?


The government is also proposing to cut eligibility for cash and medical benefits from 36 to 18 months. About 60 percent or 9,000 refugees will lose their benefits if this is passed.


On top of this, the State Department is allowing more refugees into the country and the Indochinese population here is expected to keep increasing by about 200 to 500 people a month. And the overall employment picture here in Washington does not look very good.


The alternative to this bleak situation. I feel, is developing Indochinese self-reliance. This means the long term development of Indochinese MAAs to provide services, and, as I said before, the economic development of the Indochinese community.

As we enter 1982, The Examiner presents a recap of some of the major stories and issues which have created an impact on the Asian community over the past year. The stories and issues are presented, roughly, in chronological order.


Redress


In January. The Examiner reported on the appointments to the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians. Redress to those interned during World War II was a significant issue in the Japanese. American community here. People put in many hours preparing for and testifying before the Commission when it came to Seattle in early September. The Commission took its traveling road show throughout the country, taking testimony on damages which Japanese Americans and Aleuts endured during their incarceration during World War II. People testified on the wartime climate, property losses, compensation schemes, legal precedents for redress, and social and psychological implications of incarceration. Many Japanese Americans spoke openly of the evacuation for the first time in their lives. Frank Chin and others, however, accused the Japanese American Citizens League of complicity in the evacuation and incarceration. A report is expected with recommendations for redress, probably this spring.


Hito Hata


We reported that Hito Hata: Raise the Banner would make its premiere showing in Seattle in February. Produced by Visual Communications of Los Angeles, featuring music by Hiroshima, the movie played before packed audiences at the Toyo Cinema. The overwhelming response necessitated the scheduling of additional shows. Ironically, the film, which focused on the Japanese American experience made its premiere showing in Seattle on February 19, the anniversary of the signing of Executive Order 9066, which called for removal of Japanese Americans into World Warll camps.


Martial Law


In January, we also reported that President Ferdinand Marcos had announced that he was lifting the Martial Law which he had imposed on the Philippines on September 22, 1972. Locally, such groups as the Anti-Martial Law Coalition and the Philippines Solidarity Network expressed doubt that Marcos was going to permit organized opposition to his regime. Several anti-martial law groups called the Marcos action a ""sham.""


Bilingual Education


In February, we reported on a bill pending in the State Legislature which would no longer require bilingual education in the schools and would allow, instead, English as a Second Language (ESL) programs to satisfy the language needs of immigrant children. A modified version of the bill which passed replaced the requirement of ""intensive English instruction"" in the original bill with ""special instruction to improve proficiency in English.""


Social Service Cutbacks


In March, we reported that President Reagan was proposing elimination of Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) funds, a primary source of money for several social service agencies in the District, including the Chinese Information and Service Center, the International Drop-In Center, the Denise Louie Day Care Center, and The Examiner. In addition, we reported that Reagan had proposed the elimination of the Community Services Administration (CSA), a primary source of funding for Inter*Im. Reagan did eliminate the CETA program and CSA in September. The cutbacks caused the layoff of . . . vice workers in the District and a reduction in services. Social service agencies still face uncertain funding because of another round of budget cuts expected in the coming year.


Bush-Asia Center


In April, we reported that the Bush Hotel community center was nearing completion. The Bush-Asia Center, housing commercial shops and social service agencies, officially opened its doors to the public on September 25. The Bush Hotel, owned and operated by the Seattle Chinatown-International District Preservation and Development Authority (PDA), was originally built as a hotel in 1916.


International Children's Park


Another landmark has been added to the International District. As we reported in April, the International Children's Park was nearing completion. The park has a straight slide, a spiral slide, a miracle whirl, and a bridge over a rock mountain which sways when walked upon. The project was completed at a cost of $186,000, funded from City Block Grant funds and matching grant from the Interagency on Outdoor Recreation. The dedication for the park was held in June.


Cannery Union Murders


On the first of June, Cannery Union officials. Silme Domingo and Gene Viernes were killed as they were working on summer dispatching for the fish runs at the Alaska canneries. Silme and Gene, shot down in cold blood at the union hall, were both respected leaders and good friends to many in the Asian community. The Examiner itself had ties to both Gene and Silme -- Silme was a member of the Alaska Cannery Workers Association, the publisher of The Examiner in the late seventies, while Gene contributed many articles to the paper. Hailed as heroes, cast as radicals, Silme and Gene became martyrs to a cause -- the cause of union reform. In the aftermath of the shootings, the union ousted President Constantine ""Tony"" Baruso in November, 1981. During the summer months of 1981 limmy Ramil and Pompeyo Guloy, Jr. went on trial and were convicted for the murders of Gene and Silme. Another suspect, Tony Dictado, currently awaits trial, scheduled for the Spring of 1982, Baruso was picked up in relation to the murders, but was later released for lack of evidence.

The Philippines image during the last nine years of martial law rule has been tarnished by political, economic and military abuses and beset by the growing opposition of the National Democratic Front (NDF), the protracted guerrilla warfare of the New People's Army (NPA) and the fight for autonomy by the Bangsa Moro Army (BMA), the military arm of the Muslims in the southern part of the country.


With the open support of the Reagan administration, however, Ferdinand Marcos is on the threshold of a massive repression campaign against Filipino political dissenters and suspects here in the United States as well as in the homeland. The recent massacre of 45 men, women and children in Barrio Sag-Od, Las Navas, Northem Samar confirmed the growing militarization in the Philippines.


Unknown to many U.S. Filipinos, the Reagan administration recently signed an extradition treaty with the Marcos government. Once this treaty is ratified by the United States Senate sometime this month, it will make Marcos a more powerful man. He would be able to ""legally"" intimidate and terrorize anti-government activists within the Filipino community in America. He would be able to demand the return to the Philippines of any dissenter by simply fabricating a criminal charge against him.


While the treaty expressly states that it does not cover political offenses, it is important for all Filipinos to take a political look at the way it would be implemented. Dr. Walden Bello, newly-elected co-coordinator of the Coalition Against the Marcos Dictatorship, explains, ""Marcos continues to make laws by decrees and can define political acts as mere criminal activity to suit his purpose of squelching opposition.""


Another treaty loophole is the general nature of some provisions that can lead to open interpretation. For example, anybody who violates custom laws or incites a riot is subject to extradition. Article II states that anything not listed in the appendix is covered as long as it is considered an offense in both countries. Question: Who will define whether an act is an offense?


From this latest legal maneuver of Marcos, one can easily conclude that his intention has more to do with an obsession with political power and a sense of insecurity than with prosecuting criminals who surely would not be of any use to him.


Ironically, while the U.S. lauds itself on being the champion of human rights and continues to engage the present military government of Poland with moralistic protests, it continues to support a government which is daily engaged in human rights violations.


While the U.S. government officially criticizes Poland for declaring martial law, for unjust treatment of its workers, media censorship and killing of some Poles to achieve normalization, it continues to remain silent on the violation of basic freedom in the Philippines. For once, why can't the U.S. confront the Marcos government on the disappearances of Orlando Fideris, Carlos Tayag, Manny Yap, Jessica Sales, to mention a few? For once, why can't it question Marcos on the continued incarceration of Jose Ma. Sison, Satur Ocampo, Fidel Agcaoili, Bernabe Buscayno, Victor Corpuz, Sixto Carlos and other political detainees?


If all this means anything, it means that the treaty, as described by the National Committee To Oppose the Extradition Treaty, ""is a natural offspring of the Reagan administration's efforts to create proper domestic conditions to support its foreign policy of all-out support for right-wing regimes. The presence of outspoken opposition groups within the minority communities -- among Filipinos, Haitians, and Salvadoreans -- is seen as a major threat to the effort to create a domestic consensus for a reactionary policy.""


Filipinos should not accept the extradition treaty on bended knees. We need to express our concern and outrage over the man-made forces that will permit the passage of legislation that violates human rights. Now more than ever, Filipinos all over the U.S. need to join in a common united action. It is certainly worth the risk.

For many years, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) denied tax-exempt status to non-profit organizations which discriminated against minority people. The basic reasoning for this denial was that the federal government should not provide any type of benefit to organizations which did not treat minority people in the way they treated the white people.


Bob Jones University applied for tax exempt status several years ago, arguing that it was organized for an educational purpose, a fundamental basis for taxexempt status. The value of a tax exempt status for an organization or an institution is immense -- donors who contribute money to the organization get tax write-offs while the institution itself has limited tax liability. However, the IRS denied the application of Bob Jones University for its tax exempt status because of its racially discriminatory practices. The founders of Bob Jones University and its faculty and staff subscribe to the theory that minority people and white people should be segregated from one another. Miscegenation strictly forbidden. For many years, Bob Jones University did not admit black people. Today, about a dozen blacks attend the school, but the school limits contact between the races. Interracial dating, for example is barred.


Greensboro University, another institution which applied for tax-exempt status several years ago on the basis that it was organized primarily for educational purposes, was denied tax-exempt status as well. Greensboro University does not admit any minority students.


But, during early January, both Bob Jones University and Greensboro University obtained their tax-exempt status when President Reagan reversed the long standing IRS policy.


President Reagan's rationale for allowing these institutions to obtain their tax-exempt status was that there was no specific law to deny these organizations their tax-exempt status. He said the IRS was taking the law into its own hands. Bob Jones IV, president of Bob Jones University, was overjoyed. In interviews with the press, Jones said the issue was not one of racial discrimination, but of religious freedom.


Reaction was swift. Reagan was denounced as a racist by most of the leading civil rights organizations in the country.


After conferring with his staff and some black appointees, Reagan declared that he was against racial discrimination and against any institution or organization that practiced racial discrimination. Reagan said he would fight racism with ""every moral fiber of [his] being.""


But he left the tax exemptions in place. Some said Reagan gave the speech to get civil rights organizations off his back. Reagan said institutions which openly admit racially segregationist or exclusionary policies should not be denied their tax exemptions until there is a specific law which prohibits it.


Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 stated, ""No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be otherwise subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.""


This law and the regulations which interpret this law are cited whenever an educational institution has been found to have discriminated against minority people on the basis of race. It is this law which is cited as the justification of the IRS action to deny tax-exempt status to Bob Jones University. Greensboro University and other discriminatory educational institutions.


As anyone connected with non-profit organizations knows, it is very difficult to raise money without having tax-exempt status. Reagan's decision to permit tax-exempt status for Bob Jones University encourages the mentality that feeds groups like the Ku Klux Klan and the Nazi Party.


It is not difficult to imagine more sophisticated members of the Klan approaching linen manufacturers, asking them to donate white sheets for a tax write-off. With a tax-exempt status in hand, the Klan could have something that it never had before -- official recognition. And it could promote the growth of racism.


Reagan's decision to allow tax-exempt status to groups which discriminate may be the greatest thing for recruitment to the Ku Klux Klan since discovery of the burning cross. It certainly does not discourage recruitment. But Reagan's right on one count -- there ought to be a law. And, if he had looked, he would have found that the law is already there.

The many reports by the media about the escalating civil war in El Salvador evoke both elation and distress. Elation because the guerrillas, reported to be as young as 12, are gaining strategic advantage. And distress, because it is equally evident that the U.S. is all out to increase military aid to the beleaguered civilianmilitary government. Three weeks ago the Reagan administration disclosed that it was sending an extra $55 million in military aid and planned to ask Congress for $100 million more in economic aid.


What is painful -- despite pronouncements made by the U.S. State Department that the Salvadoran government has made progress in reducing human rights violations -- is the fact that repression in El Salvador is increasing and often protection of the victims comes too late.


Amnesty International, an organization dedicated to the protection and advancement of human rights, issued the following statement. During 1980, the government of El Salvador repeatedly claimed that independent ""anti-communist"" death squads beyond official control were responsible for these abductions and murders. The assertion, however, directly contradicts evidence compiled by Amnesty International from hundreds of individual cases attributing responsibility for serious violations of human rights to regular security forces. It would appear that by consistently attributing the detentions, tortures and assassinations of alleged members of the opposition to groups beyond government control, the government of El Salvador is seeking a means of evading responsibility for the actions of its own security forces.


Bob Rivard, Dallas Times Herald reporter, goes to say that even the U.S. embassy keeps records of the death squad victims which account for only a fraction of the dead. Such biased data is repeated by the administration as it tries to justify its support.


Accurate or not, the common thread of these reports is that, to a large extent, human rights violations are attributable to state policies that are often officially disowned, but implemented just the same. A recent example is the killing of almost 20 civilians in the town of San Francisco de Lempa which, as expected, was denied by the local security forces.


The Reagan administration, try as it does, is indeed hard put to hide these atrocities from the American public. Ironically, acting in the name of ""democracy"" and ""to prevent the leftists from taking power,"" the U.S. is bent on supporting the repressive military junta of El Salvador at whatever cost.


However, there is one very encouraging development. Wise to the wiles of the U.S. government as exemplified by the many years of imperialist intervention in countries like Vietnam, Iran and the Philippines, many Americans and concerned citizens of various nationalities are not leaving matters to pronouncements of official benevolence. Many in increasing number continue to oppose the present posture of the U.S. in El Salvador.


An example of the people's initiative is the recent fundraising launched by actoractivist Ed Asner and other Hollywood sympathizers in support of the guerrillas fighting under the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front -- the umbrella organization of all those opposed to the military junta.


More than making an impact, Ed Asner's bold act immeasurably engenders the Americans' consciousness of their strength and capability to support the Salvadorans in their historic attempt to establish sovereignty within their homeland, a sovereignty whose ideological foundation is for them to decide and not for the U.S. to impose.

The following interview was conducted earlier this month with Martin Gonzales, spokesperson for the Committee in Solidarity with the People of El Salvador (CISPES). Before joining CISPES, Gonzales was active with the Latin American Students and Workers Association and the Chicano Student Movement.


Q: What is causing the civil war in El Salvador?


A: Basically the cause is socio-economic inequalities. It is a matter of the Salvadorans demanding what is rightfully theirs. The people are no longer willing to accept that in a country of five million people, only two percent control the land and all the means of production. And 92 percent of the land owners dispose only 22 percent of the workable land. I think that the people are tired of not being able to send their kids to school; 50 percent of the people are illiterate. Inflation is running at 40 percent. Unemployment rate is 35 percent. People are really in extreme poverty. One out of four children dies of malnutrition before reaching the age of five. These living conditions are not imported from Russia and Cuba; neither is the revolution. The worsening economic conditions plus the extreme repression of the government security forces and paramilitary organizations have forced the people to rebel and wage a legitimate defense of their rights and dignity. The struggle is led by the FDR (Democratic Revolutionary Front) and the FMLN (Farabundo Marti Front for National Liberation).


Q: What is the FDR-FMLN?


A: The FDR is the political representation of the Salvadorans. It is not a small group of Leftists but rather a majority of the Salvadoran people. It includes in its ranks popular mass organizations which are composed of peasants, laborers, teachers, students, professionals, technicians, small and medium businessmen, slum dwellers, the National University and the Catholic University Jose Simeon Canas, the Social Democrat Party, the Social Christian Movement, the Popular Church, and the major trade union federation that comprise 90 percent of the organized working class.


The FMLN is the popular army and it includes five politico-military organizations. They are the Popular Forces of Liberation Farabundo Marti (FPL), National Resistance (RN), Revolutionary Army of the People (ERP), Armed Forces of Liberation (FAL), and Central American Workers Party (PRTC).


Q: What is wrong with the present government of El Salvador?


A: First of all, the Christian Democrat-Military junta is responsible for 80 percent of the deaths in El Salvador. The number of assassinations in the past two years surpassed 32,000. It does not have the popular support and the only thing it is doing is oppressing and repressing the Salvadorans by protecting the vested interests of a small minority of oligarchs.


Q: How would you describe the role that the US is playing in El Salvador?


A: The role of the US is not something that we ought to be proud of. The US is maintaining in power an unpopular repressive regime against the wish of the majority of the people in El Salvador, and an increasing number of people here in the US. The US is intervening in the internal affairs of El Salvador. Recently the Reagan administration has announced plans to train 1500 Salvadoran soldiers in the US. The training of a 1000-man infantry battalion at Fort Bragg has already started; 500 to 600 junior officers are also training at Fort Benning. I just cannot understand why the US is in favor of the Poles' fight for self-determination, but against the Salvadorans' fight for freedom and democracy. Isn't it a form of double standard morality?


Q: Would you say that the situation will become another Vietnam?


A: In Vietnam the US involvement started with military evaluators.


A: In Vietnam the US involvement started with military evaluators, followed by sending military advisors and military aid. Finally, combatants were sent to support an unpopular regime. The same pattern seems to be happening in El Salvador. The Reagan administration sent 50 military advisors to train Salvadoran soldiers in Vietnam-style counterinsurgency techniques such as the use of Huey helicopters and the creation of ""search-and-destroy"" brigades. Then there is the military aid. And now massive training programs for Salvadoran troops are going on in Fort Bragg, home of the Green Berets. All these developments point to a direction of a new Vietnam in Central America.


Q: Where does the Catholic Church stand?


A: The hierarchy is split into three groups. There is the anti-people headed by a bishop who is also a colonel in the Armed Forces. Then, there is the non-people group. These are the priests and religious who are afraid to commit theirselves. Finally, there is the pro-people which is discreetly supporting the revolution.


Q: Does El Salvador get any support from friendly countries like Nicaragua and Cuba?


A: I don't know of any material support coming from Nicaragua and Cuba. What I am sure of is that these countries recognize the Salvadorans' struggle for liberation and morally support them.


Q: What is your group's evaluation of the military in terms of its fighting capability?


A: The correlation of forces are certainly in favor of the guerrillas. As a result, the morale of the military is very low. Replacement is its major problem. In fact, 15-year-old kids are drafted. Fighting has also increased in the cities and this only means severe toll on the military.


Q: How would you assess the present guerrilla struggle?


A: The FMNL has visibly grown stronger and continues to enlarge the portions of El Salvador under its control. The guerrillas are stronger especially in the northern and eastern parts of the country which are historically guerrilla strongholds. A Washington Post article by Alma Guillermeprieto in November mentioned that the army has lost approximately one-quarter of the country to FMLN. According to a UPI wire story, the FMLN guerrillas have inflicted casualties on 1455 government troops -- nearly 10 percent of the Armed Forces -- during the past 11 months. It might also be good to mention that the US State department stated that if US would stop helping, the junta would fall in two months. That's how strong the guerrillas are.


Q: What is CISPES?


A: CISPES stands for Committee in Solidarity with the People of El Salvador. It is a national organization composed of religious and human rights groups opposed to US intervention in El Salvador. We stand in support of the Salvadorans struggle led by the FDR and FMLN. Our work involves education, protest efforts and humanitarian aid campaigns. Since CISPES was formed in October, 1980, it has grown to about 300 local chapters and affiliates.


Q: What can the American public do to help the Salvadorans?


A: One is to consciously update themselves with what is going on in El Salvador and reflect on the events critically. Secondly, they can always provide moral and logistical support. One has but to remember that currently there are an estimated 300,000 displaced Salvadorans in the homeland and another 250,000 refugees. I also encourage our sympathizers to join us in some of our political protests. In fact this coming March 27 we're staging a demonstration to protest the US intervention in El Salvador. Assembly point is the Federal Building along 2nd Avenue at 12 noon. CISPES can be contacted at 323-5698.

The Indochinese refugees have become the latest victims of Ronald Reagan's ""War on Poverty."" Massive cuts in federal aid to the Indochinese refugees could leave them homeless, jobless, and hungry, Legal Services attorneys have gone to court to prevent the cutoff of federal aid to the refugees.


When President Reagan announced the first of many federal spending cuts, he said he would not cut off federal aid to those he described as the ""truly needy."" After his announcement, he proceeded to cut or proposed to cut federal funds to the hungry, the handicapped, the elderly, the poor, and the children. So why should he act any different toward the Indochinese refugees?


Many of the Indochinese refugees threatened by the loss of federal funds are people who took up the side of the United States government in the unpopular Vietnam War. When the U.S. pulled out of Vietnam, these people had little choice but to escape from Southeast Asia. Does the United States government have a moral obligation to the refugees? Obviously, the Reagan administration doesn't think so.


The Indochinese refugee is new to this country, new to the language, new to the culture, new to the educational system, and new to the standard of living. The problem of the refugees is not only their problem; it is society's problem. If you ignore them, they will not go away. Where would they go to?


Whether they like it or not, the Reagan administration has got to realize that there are some people who will not get by without federal assistance. Reagan himself has said so on many occasions, that those he defined as the ""truly needy"" cannot get by without federal assistance. If the refugees aren't the ""truly needy,"" then I don't know who is.


Are the Indochinese refugees a ""special interest group?"" Sure, they are ... just like the handicapped, the poor, and the elderly. It's just that these ""special interest groups"" don't have lobbyists like the tobacco industry, the oil industry, and the corporations who hobnob with the ""white tie and tuxedo"" set in Washington D.C.


Ordinarily, when social service cuts are made, the Reagan administration states that the private sector will pick up the slack. Reagan has steadfastly maintained that the private sector will provide the social services, the jobs, and the aids formerly provided by the federal government, even though that is not happening. Reagan has said over and over that social services are not the concern of the federal government. Well, hell, let's be consistent. Tobacco subsidies should not be the concern of the federal government. Personally, I'd rather have my tax dollars go to the refugees rather than the tobacco farmer. And I smoke.

One of the highest ranking Japanese Americans in the Reagan administration is the recently appointed regional administrator for the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) William Y. Nishimura.


Nishimura a native Seattleite who lived in the International District until he was 10 years old, is responsible for all federally-funded housing and community development projects in Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Alaska.


Nishimura came to HUD on March 1 after serving 11 years as executive director of the Seattle Housing Authority (SHA). He was one of the first Asians in the country to reach public housing's upper levels of management.


Nishimura worked at SHA for 32 years, starting as a cashier and working his way up through the ranks.


Under Nishimura's directorship, SHA developed a national reputation as one of the best run and most fiscally-sound public housing authorities in the country.


Several innovative programs were started at SHA under his direction, including the Neighborhood Housing Rehabilitation Program, the Scattered-Site Program and the Seattle Senior Housing Program.


The number of SHA managed housing units almost doubled, from 4,497 to 8,889, during Nishimura's term as executive director.


Nishimura, who will work out of HUD's Region 10 office, says his new post with HUD will be more administrative and less centered on management. ""With SHA I was closer to the residents and applicants,"" he explained. ""Here I have a lot of specialists and experts in their respective fields heading up the departments."" Nishimura is responsible for 450 to 475 HUD employees in this region, scattered over four states, the same number of employees he had at SHA.


Besides the geographic expansion of his responsibilities, Nishimura handles a broader scope of programs. At SHA, Nishimura only had to deal with several kinds of public housing, but at HUD there are up to 67 types of housing. Within each region there are different disciplines such as community planning, regional counsel offices, regional housing offices, Indian Programs, and Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity Programs.


Explaining why he took his new post Nishimura said, ""After 32 years I thought it was time for a change, time to take on new challenges.""


Nishimura feels one of HUD's primary goals is stressing to local public housing authorities the importance of continuing the existing quality of housing. ""One of the major objectives is to maintain the quality of the housing units and maintain the various services we already have,"" he said. ""Of primary importance is the dwelling units. People always want to build more, but not maintaining what you already have defeats the purpose of what public housing stands for.""

Dolores Sibonga, the first minority woman ever elected to the Seattle City Council, has recently stepped into the forefront in another way. She's expressed strong opposition to the nuclear arms build-up and civil defense planning for nuclear war.


Sibonga last month moderated a public forum on the effects of nuclear war on Seattle and King County, with speakers from Physicians for Social Responsibility and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).


The physicians group, which is urging a halt to the nuclear arms race, argues that the massive escalation in the number of nuclear weapons saps money from essential human services. The group opposes the ambitious and expensive civil defense planning proposed by Reagan, to be administered by FEMA.


Sibonga -- fellow Council members Michael Hildt and Virginia Galle, and Seattle Mayor Charles Royer -- have joined Concerned Local Elected Officials Opposing Preparations for Nuclear War, a group calling for temporary suspension of nuclear weapons production. The elected officials say even a ""limited"" nuclear war would ""result in death, injury and disease on a scale unprecedented in human history.""


Sibonga said the public forum was intended to ""bring information on the civil defense plan to elected officials so they would realize how unfeasible it is to relocate one million people to Eastern Washington if there was a nuclear attack.""


FEMA's ""crisis relocation"" plans specify, in the event of an attack, that Puget Sound survivors would move to other countries in the state at assigned times. Sibonga pointed out that the evacuation process was expected to require 48 hours, then 72 hours and ""now I've been hearing 80 hours.""


The host countries in Eastern Washington do not have the facilities or shelters to accommodate fleeing Seattle survivors of a nuclear attack, she said. The plans are useless if the United States receives a surprise attack, she noted.


""Even if we had time to prepare, I think people would panic,"" Sibonga said. ""For example, I live on Beacon Hill. I would have to wait 46 hours before I head across the Lake Washington Floating Bridge to Benton County near Hanford. It's already bad enough now with rush hour traffic.""


Sibonga said she supports a freeze on the production of nuclear weapons because ""if you waited to have parity between the Soviets and the U.S. in each of the armament areas, you wait forever.""


""There is no reason,"" she said, ""for us to wait for parity when we have the same ability to destroy each other one hundred times over.""


The arms build-up diverts resources from other areas that need money, she said. And she added that military spending tends to be wasteful: ""Even before the blueprints are drawn, the weapon becomes obsolete. That's even more so with nuclear weapons.""


Sibonga credits Washington State Congressional Representative Mike Lowry with first raising the issue of nuclear arms control. And she says Physicians for Social Responsibility, which has protested that physicians would be unable to treat the numerous victims of a nuclear attack, has brought credibility to the movement against the prospect of a nuclear nightmare.


King County Executive Randy Revelle, in early April, ""made a tentative decision not to participate in the FEMA crisis relocation plan because it didn't make sense from a cost-benefit standpoint,"" said Larry Phillips, his executive assistant. Revelle spent four years in the Pentagon working for former Defense Secretary. Robert McNamara. Revelle's decision is tentative because it is uncertain whether federal funding for crisis relocation in the event of nuclear attack is ""tied directly to natural or technical disasters such as chemical spills,"" Phillips added.


According to an aide to Seattle Mayor Charles Royer, the Mayor has not yet spoken out on whether the City will participate in the crisis relocation plans, although he has called for a freeze on the build-up of nuclear weapons. Seattle City Council member Jack Richards, who heads the committee on public safety and health is expected to hold hearings on the completed FEMA plans this fall.


Sibonga said many other local issues she considered as an elected official are overshadowed by the issue of nuclear war.


And she said that, as an Asian woman she was moved by newspaper photos depicting the human tragedy of Hiroshima. In college, she wrote a paper on John Hersey's ""Hiroshima,"" a paper which her professor read to the class as ""the one which got to the point of the book.""


""Asian people have a big stake in this issue,"" she said. ""It was because of racist attitudes that the bombs were dropped on Japan and not Germany. It was because of racism that the Japanese were put into the camps and not the Germans.

The House of Representatives recently approved an amendment offered by Congressman Mike Lowry (D-Wash.) to the Urgent Supplemental Appropriations bill. Lowry's amendment provides $23 million in federal funds to reimburse states for the cost of cash and medical assistance benefits to refugees who were cut off from federal benefit programs by the Reagan Administration on April 1. Washington State is expected to receive $3 million of the funds.


On June 9, a conference committee of the House and Senate accepted Lowry's amendment, which means that the only other potential stumbling block might be if President Reagan were to veto the appropriation.


The Reagan Administration issued regulations to cut benefit eligibility for needy Southeast Asian refugees from 36 to 18 months. This policy change, scheduled to take effect April, would have resulted in the termination of 78,000 refugees. According to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, approximately 85 to 90 percent of these needy people are not eligible for any other welfare programs.


Congressman Lowry, extremely disturbed by the Administration position, pointed out that the Refugee Act of 1980 clearly states that refugee resettlement is a federal responsibility. The Act requires federal funding to meet the cash and the medical assistance needs of refugees for their first 36 months of U.S. residence, Lowry stated. The Administration's failure to meet this obligation is inexcusable, he said. Until the provisions of the Refugee Act are changed, he argued, the Administration should not alter the refugee program.


Because of court litigation or other reasons, 19 states did not implement the rules change. In Washington, this impending crisis was postponed for two months due to court litigation. But recent court rulings will allow the federal government to implement the new regulations. The court decisions allowed aid cuts to go into effect on June 1.


Approximately 78,000 Asian refugees will be left without any basic support. In Washington State, over 9,000 people will be cut off, causing unnecessary hardships and confusion among people not accustomed to Western - culture and not equipped with the work training and language skills necessary to function in American society.


Since announcement of the rules change by the Reagan Administration, Lowry has worked to block implementation of the new regulations. Lowry introduced a bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to require that federal refugee assistance be provided for not less than 100 percent of cash and medical assistance costs during the first 36 months refugees are in the United States. The bill now has 20 cosponsors and has been referred to the judiciary Committee.


As the implementation date grew closer, Congressman Lowry sought short term relief through the Temporary Urgent Supplemental Appropriations bill. After two months of persistent work, the House of Representatives passed Lowry's amendment to add over $23 million for refugee cash and medical assistance. Under this amendment, it is estimated that Washington will receive $3 million from the federal government to reimburse the state for two months of cash and medical assistance costs incurred from delay of the rules change.


Reducing welfare dependency and relieving government costs are the stated objectives of the Administration's rule change. But the way to reduce welfare dependency is to quickly train refugees and help them find jobs. Far from cutting government costs, the Administration's new regulations will simply transfer the costs to already overburdened state and local governments.


Over 50 percent of the funding for refugee social services and English language assistance has been cut, the result of federal spending reductions and the subsequent loss of state matching funds. If the Administration were truly interested in reducing welfare dependency, it would increase funding for English language instruction, job training and placement of refugees.


In Washington State, the unemployment rate is close to 13 percent. The national unemployment rate is presently 9.4 percent. Unlike the first wave of refugees, people in the second wave are from rural, preliterate backgrounds. They have proven that they can develop the skills to function effectively in American society, but effective government programs are needed to help them complete this process. To implement the regulations and cut off the only means of support for thousands of people will not square with the Administration's reasons for taking this cruel and drastic measure.


Congressman Lowry is firmly committed to the principle that the federal government has a responsibility to help refugees become self sufficient. ""It is shameful to eliminate benefits for refugees who came to our country to escape political persecution, particularly during these times of limited job opportunities,"" said Lowry. ""The U.S. government promised and owes the Southeast Asian refugees the chance to become independent, productive members of our society, and achieving these goals is in the interests of every American.""


Sometimes, it seems that Administration officials have forgotten the reason why Southeast Asian refugees have come to our country. They were good enough allies to risk their lives during this country's wars in Southeast Asia when our U.S. forces needed them. Because many of them had worked so closely with Americans, they could not stay for fear of political reprisals.


These aid cuts will put gaping holes in the Southeast Asian community's safety net."" It's easy to wonder if the refugees needs are so easily sacrificed because they cannot vote. There are approximately 587,000 Southeast Asian refugees living in the United States. In . . . few years 370,000 will be eligible to vote. What happens today will shape their perspective of our government and society.


Over the past couple of years, the political response to many of our problems has been shortsighted. It seems that we have forgotten that our entire society benefits from self-help programs such as refugee assistance. Hopefully. Southeast Asian voters will join with Asian Americans and other groups who have suffered from discrimination, in moving forward and trying to make this a better country for all its people.

This column has been developed as an ongoing project of the Asian Pacific Women's Caucus which meets the second Tuesday of every month at 6:30 p.m. in the Bush Community Center. All interested persons are invited to attend. For more information please call Sally Kazama (evenings) 722-4361.


A couple of years ago I suggested to Karen Denard who was then host of a weekly radio show on KING, that she make the refugee issue the focus of one of her programs. She did and I was one of the guests.


We talked about the cultural barrier facing refugees and the difficulties of obtaining a job in a totally new culture. We talked about the adaptability of refugees and their eager interest in learning English so that they could become self-sufficient. We discussed how the welfare system makes them feel shame, but that they had to rely on it to survive and feed their families. After our refugee discussion, we waited for calls and questions.


A burst of angry and spiteful people called to air their views about the mass of foreigners coming taking their jobs, and getting handouts. And they were quite articulate about their rage -- a rage born of misconceptions and misplaced frustrations.


High unemployment rates account for much of the resentment aimed at refugees. The frustration turns into anger. Anger directed toward a group with no real political clout, no actual power.


Never mind that the refugees take mostly blue collar jobs, primarily in the restaurant business and food processing industry. Never mind that; under the Refugee Act of 1980, the American government promised three years of support for them. With each editorial on refugees in the Seattle Post Intelligencer or the Seattle Times, with every article about the federal government threatening to cut off aid to refugees and citing the U.S.'s moral responsibility, the hate mail surfaces and the outpouring of anger increases.


The Reagan Administration, reneging on its commitment to provide refugees three years of welfare support, claims that its action will result in greater cost efficiency and put the refugees on an equal footing with the rest of the poor in this country.


However, as an editorial in the Seattle Post Intelligencer on March 18, 1982 stated. The catch here is that the biggest category of welfare. Aid to Families with Dependent Children, is limited to single-parent families. If Dad's around as he is in most refugee households -- the government won't pay.


Washington State has the third largest refugee population in the nation. There are 31,000 Southeast Asians here. What, will the refugees do without these funds? The unemployment rate here is over 12 percent. When thousands of English-speaking, trained and educated workers can't find jobs, there's little chance that untrained Indochinese hampered by language and cultural barriers can.


It should be noted that not everyone who called vented anti-refugee opinions. A few callers indicated sympathy toward a group of people whose culture and country had been ravaged; a few were aware that, to survive, many Indochinese had to leave their own countries.

About 100 delegates of the Japan Congress Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs (Gensuikin Movement), returning from the United Nations, Special Session on Disarmament, spoke to gatherings at the Friend's Center and the Japanese Buddhist Church last month, spreading their message about the critical need for international nuclear disarmament.


The Japanese delegation stopped over in Seattle before going home to Japan after presenting to the United Nations in New York 30 million signatures for their petition. The positions listed on the petition were.


-- to make known the after effects on the victims of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings and the victims of nuclear testing elsewhere in the world;


-- to pass an international law banning nuclear weapons as a crime against humanity;


-- to enforce the three non-nuclear principles -- not to invent, not to produce, and not to allow the introduction of nuclear weapons on Japanese territory, further expanding nuclear freeze zones;


-- to establish a disarmament treaty and implement it within a limited time frame.


The Gensuikin Movement began collecting signatures for their petition last November to submit to the Japanese government and the United Nations. On March 21, 1982, they achieved their goal of obtaining 30 million signatures.


All the delegates spoke through an interpreter. Reverend Kiyoko Kajiwara of the United Church of Christ, one of the 80 religious representatives in the delegation, honored the dedication and commitment of those who collected, the signatures. She acknowledged the efforts of Mr. Nagata in the audience, who contributed 7,000 signatures from former soldiers. Nagata, she said, felt regret that when he was a soldier in China, he followed orders to kill prisoners. Reverend Kajiwara also praised a lady who stood in front of the Namba train station in Japan for three days and nights to obtain 3,000 signatures.


Yoshikio Yoshida, leader of the Gensuikin delegation explained that the Reagan Administration invoked antique legislation to deny entry visas to 223 peace movement members from all over the world. ""Perhaps the Reagan Administration fears that the peace movement will obstruct the military build-up in this country and in other parts of the world,"" he said. ""But no one will have the strength or power to stop this world-wide movement calling for nuclear disarmament.""


Teshu Suzuki, a Buddhist priest, stated that he has drawn criticism for being a part of the Gensuikin Movement, ""Many people believe that religion should not be involved in politics,"" he said. ""However, a wrong policy will not only destroy the temples of the churches, but it will destroy religion itself, During the Vietnam War many churches and many temples were destroyed and burnt and many people killed. I think religion is not a privileged thing that will not be excluded from the fire of warfare. Religion itself will be destroyed during war. Therefore, nuclear weapons are the greatest enemy of religion.""


The most powerful testimony was delivered by Mr. Taniguchi, a survivor of the atomic bombing at Nagasaki:


""I was 16 years old when I rode my bicycle two kilometers away from the hypocenter of the explosion. I was burned by heat strong enough to melt stones and iron. After a while, I stood up and realized that my skin hung down from my left shoulder to the palm of my hand like a rag. My back was scorched and the burnt flesh of my body started to go rotten and melt. Then maggots developed in my body. I spent a year-and-a-half in bed with my stomach down. Thirty-seven years later, the keloids developed into skin cancer and a series of lengthy operations were required.


""I was not treated like a human being 37 years ago. Last year, President Reagan said there was a possibility of a limited nuclear war. A limited nuclear war took place at Hiroshima and Nagasaki 37 years ago.""


The Japanese peace delegation especially thanked the Issei living in Seattle for their hospitality and presented them with photo panels of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombings. This gift will be made available to the community.


Aki Kurose, coordinator of the event along with the American Friends Service Committee, felt that the response to the Japanese peace activists is a good indication of Asian American interest in the peace movement.


""We wanted the message of peace to be spread out,"" Kurose said, ""and I'm hoping that something like this will really help the Asians to get organized into a strong peace movement. So often the peace movements are in white, middle-class areas -- and although their intentions are sincere -- they are the only people who participate. This delegation would not make the same kind of impact to their (white) community as it would to our community, and it's sorely needed.""

LA JOLLA, Calif. -- On the weekend of June 25 to 27, representatives from 20 Asian Pacific women's organizations from across the country gathered here to elect leadership, identify and discuss issues and strategies for a national network.


Billed as the First Biennial Convention of the National Network of Asian Pacific Women (NNAPW), the theme of the convention was ""Unity in Leadership.""


Speaker Odetta Fujimori, member of the National Education Association Executive Committee, suggested the appropriate image of the musubi (rice ball) for the convention. As individuals and singular organizations, we are but tiny grains of rice, she said, but when placed in hot water, we stick together.


The convention was attended by 20 organizations: Asian Women United, New York; New York Asian American Professional Women; New York Asian Pacific Women's Political Caucus; California Asian Pacific Women's Network; Central Valley Asian Pacific Women's Organization; Asian Pacific Women's Network, Los Angeles; Sacramento Asian Pacific Women's Network; Pacific and Asian American Women's Bay Area Coalition; Asian Pacific Women of San Diego County; Organization of Pan Asian Women of Washington D.C., National Island Women's Association, (NIWA), California; NIWA of Hawaii; NIWA of Los Angeles; Asian Sisters in Action, Boston; Asian Pacific Women's Network of Chicago; Hawaii Council of Asian Pacific Island Women; Samoan Women for Change; Famalao an; Tongan American Society of the Asian Pacific Women's Caucus of Washington State. The Tongan American Society was formed at the convention itself as the Tongan women united.


An Issue of Parity


In defining representation and leadership, convention representatives grappled with the fact that there were more Asians than Pacific Islanders and, therefore, it was important to ensure Pacific Islanders were included in all activities. Although it was important to unify, there needed to be acknowledgement of the cultural differences that imply differences in values, communication and leadership styles.


The planning committee foresaw these issues and attempted to address them by: allotting each organization 10 votes regardless of the size of the delegation; having an Asian co-chair and a Pacific Islander co-chair; assigning three positions on the board for Asians and three for Pacific Islanders, of which only one can come from each ethnic group; assuring geographical representation by having seven identified regions elect their own representatives. Asians will elect their own board representatives as will Pacific Islanders.


The intertwined issues of parity, self-determination and minority representation for Pacific Islanders became apparent when the election of co-chairs came up. The convention delegates adopted a recommendation that both Asian and Pacific Islander co-chairs be selected by the total body.


The Pacific Islanders tried to introduce the question of self-selection of leadership prior to adoption of the rules, but failed because it was not in the form of a motion prior to the motion to adopt the rules.


Later, more than two-thirds of the voting organizations agreed to reconsider the convention rules so that the issue of self-determination could be addressed on the floor. It is to the credit of the participants that the issue was addressed and given a full agenda.


The Pacific Islanders, in their gentle, firm way, repeatedly told the participants what they wanted. And when the convention agreed to approve self-selection of leadership, there was greater respect between the Asians and the Pacific Islanders based on a truer sense of trust. If the election method interferes with the goals of the network, it can be changed sometime in the future.


It was interesting to see the spectrum of communication styles within the convention, from women who held the veneer of white middle class professional manner to the seemingly laid-back soft, gentle style of the Pacific Islanders. They, certainly taught all of us a lesson in direct nonangry, firm communication.


Election Results


Irene Hirano of California was elected Asian co-chair while Pat Luce, also from California, was elected Pacific chair. In selecting the leadership, the 20 organizations holding 10 votes each and the one atlarge Asian delegate from Minnesota who had one vote considered the skills, track record and residence of the nominees.


The location for the next conference was considered as a factor in selecting the co-chairs. There was an assumption that the Pacific Islander co-chair would be selected from outside the continental United States. To our surprise, the Pacific Island co-chair was from California. Ms. Luce was selected by the Pacific Islander women who had caucused the night before the election. Hopefully, Asians, in the future, will also caucus in a similar way to decide on our Asian co-chair together. The Pacific Islanders also decided that three women -- Samoan, Hawaiian, Chamoro -- would support the Pacific Island chair and facilitate communications within each group. ""So instead of one Pacific Island co-chair, we are getting four Pacific Island chairs,"" according to Pat Brandt, former President of the Ad Hoc Committee to draft the bylaws of the network and plan this convention.


Interestingly, the Asians acted more in a regional mode rather than an ethnic specific or ""Asian mode."" It was ironic that the Pacific Islanders were asking the Asian sisters for organizational and bureaucratic technical assistance to bring about the unity and mutual support that they had already demonstrated.


Issues and Strategies


There were no surprises in this part of the convention proceedings. Using the 1980 Educational Equity Conference resolutions as a springboard for discussion, the various issues groups jelled in recognizing the impact of the two R's -- Reagan and Recession -- on the Asian Pacific community as well as other Third World communities.


Employment and refugee problems were identified as critical. Besides the usual information sharing and discussion about protecting established civil rights and lobbying strategies, the NNAPW board recommended the formation of political action committees in each region. The success of such activities will depend on the ability of these committees to establish and stay within clearly defined perimeters; otherwise they will defeat their own purpose by biting off more than they can chew.


The political action committees need to involve more than just Asian Pacific women; the issues addressed cover more than the concerns of Asian Pacific women. It is not just the same old tune played by a different instrument; it is a call to awaken sleeping dragons.

When Kumi Kilburn became Manager of Corporate Contributions for Rainier Bank three years ago, she felt it was ""uncanny"" that her new job would combine so many things she enjoyed doing.


The job, she said, ""combined my interests in accounting, writing, interacting with senior management and also allowing me to keep my sense of community. And every part of my job I enjoy. Not each part exclusively, but all the parts together.""


Her position as Manager of Corporate Contributions requires her ""to be aware of local and state policy as they affect the banks and to also develop guidelines for those business contributions. She is currently revising the guidelines, which requires her to confer with bank committee members, other banks and outside resources to get an accurate forecast of how Rainier Bank can best serve its community.


""I am helping a major corporation to make a link with the community,"" said Kilburn, who is also an Assistant, Vice President of the Bank. ""I have an interest in improving our community, in short-term and long-term impacts. I am always looking for solutions to influence others in a positive way.""


Born in Korea, Kilburn lived in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Tokyo and then came to the United States to attend school when she was 19. She has lived here for 25 years. And she is also the niece of noted local photographer Johsel Namkung.


""My father, a physician, looked at the world and decided that he wanted his children to become citizens of the world,"" Kilburn says, explaining why she has lived in so many countries before attending college in the U.S. She, at one time, could speak Korean, Shanghai dialect, Cantonese and Japanese, but now mainly uses English.


She attended Pratt Institute, University of Washington, Columbia University and Antioch University, where she received her degree in Public Policy in 1978. She was 41 when she graduated.


""When I did volunteer work as a housewife, I didn't get any consideration,"" Kilburn said. ""People would call at 7 a.m. or 11:30 p.m. So now, there is more form to my life and I enjoy that a lot.


""It's not easy having a career and children -- four sons, 13 to 21 -- and maintaining outside interests. But because of my age, I've been able to be a full-time home-maker, volunteer and career woman. I feel I've had my cake and eaten it, too.""


Kilburn meets people in all areas of interest in screening organizations which will receive contributions from Rainier Bank. She evaluates requests and sometimes conducts on-site visits to find out as much about the groups as possible before making a recommendation to the senior officers of the Bank, who make the final decisions.


It takes about six weeks to evaluate a request. Last year, the Bank received over 600 applications for money and 250 contributions were made, of which United Way is the largest. The department's budget for 1982 is $900,000.


Before taking the job at Rainier Bank, Kilburn spent much of her time on the Lake Washington School Board, the state and national school boards, the Bellevue Community College Women's Center Advisory Board and the Kirkland Redmond Boys and Girls Clubs.


""I'm attracted to groups that educate youths rather than social service,"" she said.


But that doesn't conflict with her job, where she must deal with all types of organizations -- large universities and small social service agencies.


""I happen to really believe in Rainier Bank policies,"" Kilburn said. ""But we have to be careful in which areas and where we can make a difference. Each company has a unique focus in relation to how they make their profits, so most of our interests lie in housing employment and business education.


""The private citizens are affected by these policies, more than we think, she said. ""In Reagan's New Federalism, we (corporations) are being asked to pick up the pieces that the federal government is dropping.


But Kilburn doesn't find that necessarily discouraging, as she said she enjoys learning more and more from her job and from helping the community. She remembers laughing when she got this job though, because it was something she didn't imaging when setting her career goals. But it has turned out to be a perfect fit.


""As long as I feel I can be stimulated and challenged by my job, be rewarded for it, and continue to have personal growth. I'll be happy in my position,"" Kilburn said. ""I want to do my job better and better to impact more persons in the community.""

Thirty-seven years ago this month, World War II came to a sudden halt after the United States bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This June 12, a Japanese delegation of 1,500 flew to New York to participate in what turned out to be the largest single demonstration in American history and to present the United Nations Special Session on Disarmament with two-and-a-half tons of paper bearing signatures from half the population of Japan, calling for world disarmament.


Among the delegation were 150 hibakusha, victims of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Another 150 were detained in Tokyo, allegedly because they were associated with Communists. The hibakusha were old and ill, but on June 12, they were driven to the front of the marchers so they could walk the final steps, leading approximately one million marchers into Central Park.


The marchers came from Canada, Australia, all over Europe as well as the four corners of the United States. Marchers came down from Harlem, up from Chinatown, across the Brooklyn Bridge, and from the posh apartments on nearby Park Avenue.


Many never set foot in the Park, let alone get within sight of the stage where entertainers and politicians spoke and performed for six straight hours. The speakers ranged from Orson Welles to Jill Clayburgh, from Abbie Hoffman to The Rev. Ben Chavis, from Rita Marley to Bella. Abzug, from Barry Commoner to a variety of people from Congress. And the media was there to stalk the celebrities, not to cover the demonstration or the reasons that so much of humanity had gathered to show President Reagan that Americans will not accept the nuclear buildup, nuclear warfare, or even nuclear power.


One of the hibakusha kept saying that victims of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were only the beginning, and that hibakusha are everywhere: including Three Mile Island workers and the Navajo whose land is being stripmined for uranium to build nuclear bombs.


The sole Asian American speaker at the New York demonstration was Dr. Michio Kaku, a nuclear physicist for disarmament and former University of California at Berkeley and Harvard student activist. Kaku said that President Richard Nixon's plan to end the Vietnam War was to drop an atomic bomb on Hanoi, but it did not happen because 200,000 people demonstrated in the Nation's capital. ""There's one thing the U.S. military fears the most,"" said Kaku, ""the American people. The American people will decide again.""


It took some effort for one million people to gather in Central Park. It was more of a celebration when 50,000 gathered in San Francisco in a simultaneous demonstration. And it was great entertainment for the 100,000 who went to the Rose Bowl stadium the previous week for a peace concert led by Stevie Wonder, Jackson Browne and Linda Ronstadt. But, it was a real major effort for the 1,500 to come from Japan, stepping foot on the land of the nation which defeated Japan and which dropped bombs killing millions of innocent people and leaving many permanently ill from the radiation. Despite early day proclamations by Reagan officials discounting the demonstration, the demonstration had to have an effect. If it didn't, Seattleites should not rest easy knowing that this beautiful area is Target 1 and that nobody will survive. Peace demonstrations and activism are no longer things to be left to pacifists and hippies. It's a matter of life and death for all of us.


Former Seattleite Sharon Maeda covered the June 12 demonstration in New York for Pacifica Radio, where she is the Executive Director of the five station network of listener-sponsored radio stations. Pacifica Radio, founded in 1946 to create international understanding and peace broadcast the entire demonstration live from New York and San Francisco on the public radio satellite.

The government of President Ferdinand Marcos was behind the murders of local cannery activists Silme Domingo and Gene Viernes last June 1, 1981, just as President Augusto Pinochet was responsible for the assassination of former Chilean Ambassador Orlando Letelier and his American Associate Ronni Moffitt last September 21, 1976 in Sheridan Circle, Washington D.C.


This was the premise made by Geline Avila. coordinator of the Coalition Against the Marcos Dictatorship (CAMD), Rene Cruz who is one of Marcos ""most wanted"" men in the U.S. and Isabel Letelier. widow of Orlando Letelier, in a teach-in at Seattle University on August 7.


Avila claimed that Marcos had all the reasons to order the slayings of Domingo and Viernes because both men were noted anti-Marcos activists and were, responsible for the passage of a resolution during the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union's national convention in Honolulu last year to send a delegation to the Philippines to investigate charges of union repression. Union repression in the Philippines was confirmed by Ernesto Arellano, Secretary-General of the May First Movement (KMU), the biggest confederation of labor unions in the Philippines, in a similar symposium held in Seattle last April.


Describing the deaths of Domingo and Viernes as political murders and not just an ordinary dispatching problem, Avila charged that the killing is an example of how a repressive government, when threatened, uses repression to silence its political foes. ""This is, however, impossible without the U.S. government giving the green light,"" she added.


The Committee for Justice for Domingo and Viernes (CJDV) backed up Avila's allegation in a letter dated July 19, 1982, stating, ""The identities of the immediate hitmen have been proven in court, and the next stage of the justice work must focus on who paid them and why. Much of the evidence points to the Marcos government as the source of the murders through the use of Philippine secret police infiltrating the Filipino community, with the collusion of U.S. intelligence.""


The existence of foreign intelligence operations in the U.S. from such countries as Chile, the Philippines, Korea, Taiwan, etc. had been made public by nationally syndicated columnist Jack Anderson several years ago.


Citing the death of her husband as a classic example of how a political assassination is carried out with the consent of U.S. intelligence, Letelier said her husband had been a threat to Chile's military junta because her husband's ""exposures of the Pinochet government could lead to the reinstatement of the type of government the CIA had worked so hard to get rid of,"" She sees it as logical and probable that the CIA, because of its close ties with the DINA (Chilean intelligence), had previously known of the plan to assassinate Letelier. Later on, she said, it was uncovered that both the Letelier assassination and the bombing of/Cuban airline planes were planned at a meeting held in Dominican Republic with the presence of DINA and CIA operatives.


Cruz, editor of Ang Katipunan, the national newspaper of the Union of Democratic Filipinos (KDP), believed that political assassinations like those that happened to Domingo/Viernes and Letelier/Moffitt are drastic methods resorted to by oppressive governments, But there is another way, he said, which is legal and just as effective -- the Extradition Treaty.


He said that if the Extradition Treaty between the Philippines and the United States is ratified by the U.S. Senate all political opponents of Marcos, Cruz included, will be extradited to the Philippines and face the military tribunal and either be sentenced to life imprisonment or face the firing squad. Marcos has already announced that he will extradite Cruz.


""This is a very legal way of terrorizing the opposition here,"" he said, ""As in political murder the impact of legalized terrorism is chilling,"" Sooner or later many Filipinos and the other immigrant communities will feel the same terror.""


He pointed out that Reagan's program to permit increased spying on U.S. citizens and political organizations the deportation of Salvadorans, the training of anti-Castro Cubans and Salvadoran soldiers and the draft are all part of the administration's support for fascism abroad.


""U.S. sponsorship of war breeds repression at home."" he said. ""Repression is always the norm.""


Cruz emphasized the importance of solidarity work with other groups and immigrant communities.


""We have to defend our movement from further repression."" he said.

Dr. C. Y. Jesse Chiang, political science professor at Seattle Pacific University. will run as an independent against Senator Henry Jackson, focusing on a nuclear-arms-freeze platform.


A longtime advocate of nuclear disarmament, Chiang believes that the world is closer to a nuclear holocaust than ever before. He holds that the United States must stop the nuclear arms build-up before it is too late.


This is Chiang's third try for Congress. In 1972, he ran unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination for the 1st Congressional District, and for the Senate in 1974. Chiang believes 1982 will be his year because of the popular growth in the peace movement.


""Ten years ago when I talked about nuclear disarmament,"" Chiang said, ""people didn't know what I was talking about. Today they know! Today there is a great grass-roots movement; people from all walks of life are saying 'No' to the arms race. They want representatives who truly care for the people. They want a new direction.""


""A New Direction For Our Time"" is the motto of this independent campaign. Chiang 61 is president of the Union of Concerned Educators and a ""frequent public speaker on the nuclear arms race.


""The previous strategy was called Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD),"" Chiang explained. ""This meant that both superpowers had the power to destroy each other totally. But now the U.S. and the Soviet Union are developing first-strike weapons. These weapons are designed, not to fend off an attack, but to launch an attack and disable an enemy's opportunity to retaliate.""


Significantly these weapons are valuable only in launching an attack -- a first-strike. The Trident submarine is a first-strike weapon. Military advisors are no longer concerned with merely defending the country in case of an attack, but are considering a ""limited"" nuclear war he says.


Chiang thinks a limited nuclear war is absurd and impossible. He supports the Hatfield-Kennedy nuclear weapons freeze resolution which calls for a mutually verifiable freeze.


""The merit of the Hatfield-Kennedy freeze resolution is stopping the arms race first and then talking about disarmament. No more arms race while talking about disarmament!""


Although the nuclear arms freeze is the spearhead of his campaign, Chiang says he is not a one-issue candidate. Other issues include the economy, unemployment. women and minority rights, public housing, Social Security benefits, and environmental protection.


Chiang sees the economic woes of the country as stemming directly from the increase in military spending. Unemployment, inflation high interest rates, and cutbacks in social services are all due to the escalating defense budget.


""Reagan has called for a military budget of $1.5 trillion over the next five years,"" Chiang said. ""That is $500 billion more than Carter's $1 trillion budget! And dollar for dollar, the military produces less jobs than any other sector of the economy.


For example, one B-1 bomber costs $200 million. One Trident submarine costs $1.4 billion! These monies could all be released to serve social needs. But instead, the government is cutting back severely on social programs. Time for a new direction!""


Chiang proposes three steps to correct today's economic depression. (1) drastic cuts in military spending, (2) reduce tax cuts and introduce new equitable tax legislation to close tax loopholes, and (3) lower interest rates to below 12 percent. Chiang supports no cuts in Social Security benefits, Medicare and other services for the elderly.


A vital issue of Chiang's campaign is equal rights for women and minorities.


""Economic depressions hit minorities and women the hardest. Everyone should be equal in a democracy. And I am a great believer in democracy. But it is absurd tht half the country's population should not have equal rights. What kind of democracy is that?""


Chiang supports extending the Voting Rights Act and urges all minorities to register to vote.


""It's time everyone got involved,"" Chiang exhorted. ""Today more people are registering to vote than ever before. I urge everyone to register to vote keep up with the news, and vote for candidates who care about the people.""


About Asian American organizations such as the Japanese American Citizens League. Chiang says, ""Leadership and organization are essential to striving for equal rights. But these organizations really need new blood. They must become more politically minded and get involved in order to win these rights. Everyone must become involved that is the democratic way.


On nuclear power. Chiang supports phasing out existing, nuclear power plants and a moratorium on further plants. He supports government funded research and development on alternative energy sources, including solar and wind power.


""I am sympathetic to those who work in the nuclear plants. But the problem of waste is too great. Also these nuclear plants produce materials for nuclear weapons. Solar and wind power would not cost so much in the long run and would not pollute the environment.


Chiang believes the federal government has a role to play in helping people to own their own homes. He laments that President Reagan vetoed a public housing bill which would have provided housing and mortgage assistance to the public, Chiang is also concerned about preserving farm land in the U.S., which he says is disappearing at the rate of 2 million acres per year and proposes a task force to study this. He supports federal aid in education arts and hus manities, and mass transit. He opposes supporting repressive regimes abroad.


Born in Shanghai China in 1921 Chiang came to the United States in 1948. He received a Master's degree in political science from the University of Washington in 1951, and became a naturalized citizen in 1961. He taught at Grays Harbor College in Aberdeen, Seattle University and Seattle Pacific. University. He has lived in Seattle since 1948. except for five years in Aberdeen.


""I had few problems when I first came here,"" Chiang said ""Shanghai is very cosmopolitan and Westernized and I could speak English fluently. Of course it was hard for Chinese then people couldn't find jobs or housing. But I am an optimist, and I think the situation here has improved greatly I, believe democracy is the best way.


A writer and essayist, Chiang is currently writing a book entitled ""Stop World War III,"" and a booklet ""Five Reasons for Freeze."" His goals in life are ""to bring peace to the world, promote harmony among nations, and spread joy to all members of the human race which must prevail over the arms race.""

Reagonomics is fascinating, isn't it. Last year, President Reagan signed into law an enormous tax cut, estimated to save American taxpayers $750 billion dollars over the next five years. Last week, Reagan pushed a bill through Congress to raise $98.6 billion dollars over the next three years. It's kind of like telling the American people, ""Whoops, I think I made a little mistake last year; I gave out too much money. Could I have some of it back?""


First a massive tax cut, then a huge tax increase. Does it make sense? Shortsighted is much too nice a word to use in describing Reagan's economic advisors. How about ignorant...or foolhardy...or just plain stupid? When the tax cuts were announced last year, the wise politicians argued that it was irresponsible to cut government spending and taxes at the same time. By doing both, it kind of puts you in the same situation you were in without doing either.


Last year, when the massive tax cuts took effect, analyses showed that people earning more money benefit more from the tax cuts. People earning over $50,000 a year got a higher tax break, proportionately, than people earning under $50,000. Reagan gave wealthier people the tax break because he said they would invest in private enterprise which would stimulate the economy and create more jobs. Well, he was wrong. It didn't happen. Only the politically naive believed that would have occurred. What person with some bucks to spend is going to invest his money in some business during a tight economy? What person with some bucks to spend is going to invest in an American business when there are multi national corporations around to invest in with access to cheap labor in underdeveloped countries?


The primary effect of the massive tax cuts that Reagan had hoped would stimulate the American economy was the creation of the largest federal budget deficit in history. When Reagan ran for President back in 1980, he said that he would put the American economy back on its feet by 1983, that unemployment would be negligible by 1983, and that the federal budget would be well on it way to being balanced by 1983. Wrong again.


Increased defense spending plus massive tax cuts equals the largest federal budget deficit on record. So the smart advisors had to think of ways to cut down the federal deficit. So how do you squeeze water from a rock? The smart economic advisors to Reagan thought of a real novel idea. They got together among themselves and the bright one among them said. ""Hey, why don't we raise the taxes.""


To be fair, some of the tax increases are aimed at higher income individuals and corporations. There are provisions the tax bill aimed at closing loopholes for oil companies, investors, and life insurance companies. But in the next few months, a lot of tax accountants will be busy, trying to find new tax shelters for their clients to replace the ones that just closed up. Poor people don't have the luxury of tax shelters -- or tax accountants for that matter.


There is an incidental benefit for non-smokers. The federal tax on cigarettes will double in 1983. And that's bad news for us nicotine fiends. But it does seem strange that the federal budget has to depend on smokers to help bring down the deficit. In fact, the more people who smoke, the more people who will pay taxes to the government. On the one hand, the Surgeon General has determined that smoking is hazardous to a smoker's health which should work as an incentive to stop smoking. On the other hand, if enough people are persuaded by increased taxes on cigarettes to stop smoking less people will be paying taxes; and revenue counted on by the government in raising the taxes will be lost.


Reagan's response to questions about the economy is, of course, that Jimmy Carter and the Democrats are to blame. But Jimmy Carter didn't give the Defense Department a blank check for unlimited spending. And Jimmy Carter didn't authorize a massive tax cut in 1981. Nor did Jimmy Carter hire David Stockman. But Reagan is right about one thing. Jimmy Carter should be blamed for the rouble that our economy is in. He should be blamed for losing to Ronald Reagan.

Cannery Union reformers Gene Viernes and Silme Domingo, ""effective and prominent"" opponents of the dictatorship in the Philippines, were murdered last year by members of an elaborate conspiracy reaching to the highest levels of the U.S. and Philippine governments according to a $30 million civil suit filed last month.


The suit charges that Domingo and Viernes were murdered June 1, 1981 in the office of Local 37 of the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union by members of the Tulisan gang, acting as hitmen for agents and high officials who sought to ""silence and interfere with opponents in this country of the dictatorial regime of Ferdinand Marcos in the Philippines.""


Among those charged in the suit are former Local 37 President Constantine ""Tony"" Baruso, a staunch supporter of the Marcos regime Paul Liam, a former member of the Union of Democratic Filipinos (KDP), an anti-Marcos organization to which both Domingo and Viernes belonged; President Marcos; Imelda Marcos, wife of the Philippine president; former Secretary of State Alexander Haig; Ernesto Querubin, Philippine Counsul General in Seattle; and other past and present high government officials and agents.


The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court on September 14, seeks damages for representatives of the estates of Domingo and Viernes. Additionaliy, Renato Cruz and David Della, active members of the anti-Marcos opposition in this country, are seeking injunctive relief to hait what Della called the Marcos regime's ""long arm of repression,"" which includes surveillance and physical provocation of anti-martial law activists.


Both Della and Cindy Domingo, sister of Silme Domingo, at a press conference announcing the filing of the civil suit, cited the Philippine Infiltration Plan, a systematic effort by the Marcos regime to infiltrate agents into the community to monitor and harass anti-Marcos activists. The plan, begun in 1973, was uncovered in a secret report to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 1979.


Cindy Domingo, representing the Committee for Justice for Domingo and Viernes, said, ""Not only has the U.S. government looked the other way and refused to require the corps of Marcos agents in the U.S. to register, as required by law, but, in fact, U.S. intelligence agencies have actively cooperated with the Philippine Infiltration Plan by running interference and covering up for the activities of these agents, as well as by themselves conducting surveillance against the anti-Marcos movement.""


Domingo said Baruso, who has not yet been charged in connection with the murders of Domingo and Viernes, was part of the Philippine Infiltration Plan and ""arranged for the killings of Domingo and Viernes on orders from Marcos.""


Terri Mast, Domingo's widow and mother of his two children, Ligaya and Kalayaan, asked why no charges have yet been brought against Baruso even though the murder weapon used by the Tulisan killers was found to be registered to Baruso and evidence at two earlier trials has implicated the former Local 37 president in the slayings. She said she and other Cannery Union reformers have cooperated fully with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and have answered requests for information. She questioned whether political pressure from the Justice Department in Washington, D.C. and high officials has stifled the bringing of charges against Baruso.


George Fisher, assistant special agent for the FBI, said his office is continuing to investigate allegations of wrongdoing by Local 37 officials, but that ""unfortunately, we haven't received as much information as we'd like to have."" The FBI, he said, is trying to locate ""people with information who are willing to stand up and identify problem areas.""


Anthony Savage, attorney for Baruso, said he would file a motion to dismiss the suit sometime this week. The suit, for which the plaintiffs seek a jury trial, will be heard by U.S. District Court Judge Donald S. Voorhees. Savage last week said of the lawsuit. ""It's cuckoo. It's crazy. The whole thing is just goofy. And you can quote me on that.""


Paul Liam, another person charged with being a participant in the infiltration plan, worked with both Domingo and Viernes in KDP and other Filipino activist groups. The suit charges that Liam, acting as an intelligence operative in Seattle gathered information and photographs of anit-Marcos activists. Liam last week said he has contacted an attorney, but declined comment on the lawsuit.


And the Philippine Embassy in Washington, D.C. said, in a prepared statement issued after the announcement of the civil suit, that the suit was ""frivolous and politically-inspired designed to embarrass the state visit of President Marcos to the United States."" D.Y. Caparas, information officer for the Consulate in Seattle, declined comment on the lawsuit.


Marcos was in Washington, D.C. for a state visit with President Reagan last month. Here in Seattle, approximately 400 demonstrators marched in protest of the visit, demonstrating in front of the Philippine Consulate downtown.

The United States should express disapproval of the human rights abuses in South Korea by ending military aid to that government, a representative of the Committee for a New Korea Policy said in a phone interview last week.


David Easter, staff person for the Committee, based in Albany, New York, will speak on ""The Tragedy of U.S. Involvement"" in Seattle, Wednesday, February 16.


The Committee for a New Korea Policy supports the human rights movement in South Korea and the right of North and South Koreans to decide their own future without outside interference.


Easter, a former Quaker international affairs representative in the Tokyo office of the American Friends Service Committee, has made eight trips to South Korea and one trip to North Korea.


The South Korean government, headed by Chun Doo Hwan, a military dictator, used military aid from the United States to purchase weapons to repress those working for democracy in South Korea, Easter said. He noted that, last year, public pressure prevented the Reagan administration from authorizing the sale of 500 electric shock batons, ""usable for crowd control or torture,"" to the South Korean government.


South Korea has received more U.S. financial support than any other country in the world except Vietnam, Easter said. And the Reagan administration has requested $210 million in military aid for the Seoul regime in fiscal year 1983.


The U.S. government fuels a ""dangerous arms race on the peninsula"" by escalating the amount of aid to South Korea, Easter warned.


Additionally, Easter charges that it is illegal for the U.S. to send military aid to South Korea because the Foreign Assistance Act mandates Congress to refuse military aid to governments which violate human rights Since Chun came to power in 1980, succeeding Park Chung Hee, human rights violations have greatly increased and the labor movement has been dismantled, Easter said.


South Korea has a formidable military force, he said, and would not be left defenseless by a reduction of military aid from the United States.


The United States currently stands in the way of reunification of North and South Korea, in part because of its refusal to explore diplomatic exchanges with the North, he said.


""My wife and I have traveled to both North and South Korea,"" Easter said. ""The people in the North and South want reunification; the language, culture, customs and food are the same.


""I'm convinced that it is possible--even though it would be difficult -- to achieve a lessening of tensions and to achieve reunification if the United States doesn't stand in the way. The U.S. could start something even as simple as a cultural, scientific or educational exchange with North Korea.


""But the current policy is to stand in the way of reunification. We won't even talk to them--period.""


Easter noted that the North Korean government, since 1980, has called for the establishment of a nuclear free zone in northeast Asia. The United States has approximately 600 nuclear weapons in South Korea. Because North Korea does not have any nuclear weapons itself, he said, ""Korea could more easily be a place for the U.S. to take unilateral steps to lower tensions and work for peace.""


Easter will speak February 16 at 7 p.m. at the Friends Center, 814 Northeast 40th. For more information, call 632-0500.

The Alaska seafood processing industry continues to employ a substantial number of minorities and women in lowpaying jobs and few in higher-paying positions, according to an advisory report submitted to the United States Commision on Civil Rights earlier this month.


The report, prepared by the Alaska and Washington Advisory Committees to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, looked into allegations of employment and housing discrimination against minorities and women in the seafood industry, Alaska's largest private industry.


In a related development earlier this month, U.S. District Judge Barbara Rothstein, ruling on a class action discrimination suit brought by Asian American and Native American workers against NEFCO-Fidalgo Packing Company ordered the company to hire at least 47 percent non-whites in skilled departments, establish job qualifications for those positions, and upgrade and equalize housing among employees. Rothstein's April 5 decree followed her earlier ruling that NEFCO-Fidalgo was guilty of intentional discrimination in hiring and promotions.


Rothstein's ruling and the advisory report add official weight to discrimination allegations first raised by young cannery worker reformers in the early 1970's. Those reformers included slain cannery union officials Silme Domingo and Gene Viernes.


The reformers formed the Alaska Cannery. Workers Association in 1973 and launched class action discrimination suits against NEFCO-Fidalgo, the New England Fish Company, Wards Cove Packing Company, Inc., Bumblebee Seafoods and Columbia Wards Fisheries. The minority plaintiffs won a landmark suit against the New England Fish Company, one of the largest cannery companies in the industry at the time the suit was filed. However, a federal district judge who heard arguments in the suit against Wards Cove, Bumblebee and Columbia Wards last summer has not yet issued a ruling in the case.


The advisory report -- submitted to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, chaired by controversial Reagan appointee Clarence M. Pendleton -- charges that minorities, primarily Alaskan Natives, Filipinos, Southeast Asians and Hispanics, remain concentrated in unskilled cannery department jobs and do not learn of higher-paying, skilled and semi-skilled positions advertised through word-of-mouth.


Housing segregation continues to be a ""major problem,"" the report states. ""Some employers not only assign housing on the basis of race, but also assign to minorities housing that is inferior to that assigned to whites,"" the report continues.


Members of the Alaska and Washington Advisory Committees, announcing the findings of the report at a meeting in Juneau, Alaska last Friday, recommended that the Alaska State Commission for Human Rights and the Washington State Human Rights Commission ""conduct a compliance review"" of all companies in the seafood processing industry to determine the extent of employment discrimination. The Advisory Committees also urged the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights to urge the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to conduct a ""systematic review"" of the employment practices of those companies.


EEOC, the Alaska State Commission for Human Rights and the Washington State Human Rights Commission should initiate active education programs to inform employees of their rights under employment discrimination laws, the report recommends.


Katharine Bullitt chaired the Washington Advisory Committee and Donald Peter chaired the Alaska Advisory Committee.

A variety of events will be held this month in celebration of Asian Pacific American Heritage Week. A bill passed by Congress established the first Asian Pacific American Heritage Week in 1979. Each year, with the help of groups like the Organization of Chinese Americans, a presidential proclamation is issued declaring the week beginning May 7 an official time for the recognition of the cultural heritage and contributions of Asian and Pacific Americans.


This year's proclamation, signed by Ronald Reagan in March, states: ""Americans who have come to this land from Asian and Pacific countries have overcome great adversity and supreme challenges to make outstanding contributions to our Nation's progress in a wide range of fields - science, the arts, medicine, law, literature, agriculture, industry, commerce, and government.


""As we celebrate the accomplishments of Asian and Pacific Americans, we are grateful to them for bringing to our shores the strong and varied traditions of their homelands and for greatly enriching our institutions. We appreciate and value their presence and treasure their enduring commitment to the unalienable right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.""

The South Korean dictatorship has ""subverted both the nation's security and democratic politics,"" exiled South Korean leader Kim Dae Jung told about 300 people at the University of Washington's Meany Hall last Saturday.


Kim, regarded as a subversive by the South Korean military government because of his support for democratic rights, polled almost 46 per cent of the popular vote in a 1971 election against the late dictator Park Chung Hee, an election tainted by vote fraud.


In 1973, Kim was abducted from a Tokyo Hotel room by Korean Central Intelligence Agency members and brought back to Korea under arrest. In 1976, Kim served another prison term after he signed a declaration calling for the restoration of democracy in South Korea. And in 1980, after Park was assassinated, Chun Doo Hwan, the current dictator, sentenced Kim to death for his political activities.


Kim, in prepared remarks, said American financial aid to the South Korean government ""should increase only if our human rights situation improves.""


""Your moral support,"" Kim told the audience, ""should encourage our efforts to realize immediately our fundamental rights, including freedom of speech and press, the release of all political prisoners, removing the ban from all politicians and restoration of the right of workers to organize trade unions freely.""


Kim said some American leaders have advised ""security first, then democracy second."" But, Kim said, ""democratic freedoms are necessary to secure our country.""


""I submit to you that human rights are a precondition for stability, which is a precondition for security,"" Kim said.


Kim called for ""peaceful co-existence and eventual re-unification"" of South and North Korea. He noted, however, that North Korea has insisted on a democratic government in the south as a condition for dialogue. ""If only the South Korean government can be made democratic and enjoy popular legitimacy, then the north will be deprived of its primary argument against dialogue and peaceful co-existence,"" he said.


But, in response to a question from the audience, he said it would be ""premature"" for the United States to remove its military personnel from South Korea. The South Korean government would use the threat of Communist invasion from the north as a good excuse to ""suppress the people even more,"" Kim said, U.S. troops should be removed ""only when and after a democratic government is reinstituted in South Korea,"" Kim said.


Kim implored the audience to impress upon American leaders the need for democratic and human rights reforms in South Korea, President Reagan's invitation to Chun to be one of his first state guests in 1981 ""dampened the spirits"" of the South Korean people, Kim said. But Kim said he was encouraged by recent events, including his own release from prison.


""We want our American brothers and sisters in this room to remind your government that security without human rights was a short-lived illusion that did not last in Vietnam and will not last in Korea,"" Kim said.


He noted that Rhee Syngman, the first president of South Korea, who betrayed his mission of laying a democratic foundation,"" was overthrown in 1952. In 1979, popular uprisings in Pusan and Masan led to the assassination of Park Chung Hee, Kim said.


""How can Chun Doo Hwan succeed in suppressing our people, enjoying as he does much less prestige than his predecessors and facing much more difficult problems?"" Kim asked.

An all-out attack on the rights of immigrants is presently underway in this country. The centerpiece of this attack is the attempt in the U.S. Congress to pass the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1982, better known as the Simpson-Mazzoli bill.


This major piece of anti-immigrant legislation. backed by both political parties as well as the leadership of the AFL-CIO is on the verge of congressional passage.


When the controversial bill was introduced last year, opposition from immigrant communities and unions with large minority membership prevented its passage. But the bill, re-introduced last February, may gain passage this time because of concessions being developed by supporters and opponents and the active support of the Reagan administration. The bill has already passed the U.S. Senate.


The Provisions of the Bill


Despite revisions; the bill's main thrust is to limit immigration and create a pool of immigrants without rights. The main controversial points of the bill are as follows:


* RESTRICTIONS ON PERMANENT IMMIGRATION. Current laws permit a certain number of immigrants to gain permanent residency status in the U.S. each year. Under Simpson-Mazzoli, this ""unlimited"" provision is dropped, and an absolute ceiling of 425,000 permanent residency visas per year significantly, lower than the present rate is established. As well, through a complicated formula, this restriction, is designed to insure that permanent immigrant status is largely reserved for people from Europe and those who have significant wealth or specialized skills.


* EXPANSION OF THE NUMBER OF TEMPORARY WORKERS. While cutting back on permanent immigration, Simpson-Mazzoli will streamline procedures for employers to request unskilled, temporary workers (H-2 workers). Such temporary workers are ""ideal"" from the point-of-view of employers and the government. They have to accept conditions set by employers. They are required to pay taxes, but cannot receive any public benefits, such as unemployment benefits nor can they bring their families to the United States. They are required to go back home when the job is done.


* EMPLOYERS FACE SANCTIONS. Employers who hire undocumented workers without going through the process of the H-2 visa programs would be penalized. This provision would require unions and employers to act as the arm of the Immigration and Nationalization Service (INS) and turn in illegals or face the penalty of fines or imprisonment.


* NATIONAL IDENTIFICATION CARD SYSTEM. Workers, regardless of citizenship status, would be required to carry an identification card. Obviously this provision gives employers and the government an additional measure of control over all workers and is a significant step toward a full police state.


* LEGALIZATION. The amnesty provision, a concession designed to gain backing for the bill, is full of loopholes. First there is no guarantee that applications for permanent residency will be granted. Meanwhile, undocumented workers who submit such an application would have informed the INS of their whereabouts, leaving the door open for quick and arbitrary deportation. Second, many who apply have to go through a three year ""waiting period"" during which they would have the status of temporary workers, without access to any public benefits or unemployment benefits. Again there is no guarantee a permanent visa would be granted. The over all effect of this provision is not to grant amnesty or permanent residency to the millions of undocumented workers but rather to transfer these workers into a temporary workers category where they would be without rights and deportable.


* RESTRICTIONS ON POLITICAL ASYLUM. The bill also targets the question of refugees and in particular the granting of political asylum. The net effect of these changes would be that refugees fleeing from right-wing dictatorships would be sent back to their country of origin to face prison, torture or execution. This would be done by stream-lining the process of judicial review so that consideration would be in line with U.S. foreign policy.


Timeliness of the Bill


The Reagan administration has chosen to pour billions of dollars into an aggressive foreign policy, at the same time blaming immigrants for high unemployment among. Americans, and arguing that immigration reforms are needed to protect ""American jobs.""


This domestic policy of pointing to immigrants as the source of economic ills skillfully diverts attention away from the millions of dollars put into military aid for dictatorships, weapons systems and armaments.


The economic problems in this country will not be solved by passing a bill to make immigrants ineligible for benefits they've earned, such as Medicare, and creating a pool of workers that can be brought in for lower wages when labor is needed and sent back home when the job is done.


Looking at History


Anti immigrant hysteria is, nothing new in this country Past legislation has included Japanese exclusion acts Chinese exclusion acts and a 1930's act to exclude Filipinos. It is noteworthy to remember that the exclusion acts were passed during periods of economic depression and during the height of attacks against those Asian groups.


Where is the Asian Community?


Unfortunately, the Asian community has not been in the forefront of opposition to the Simpson-Mazzoli bill. Many believe that the provision on limits to permanent immigrants is the only threat to the Asian immigrant population. More inexcusable is the smug assumption that the bill mainly targets undocumented Mexican workers.


But the thrust of the sanctions imposed by Simpson Mazzoli can be used to rationalize further employer discrimination against all minorities who look ""foreign"" or ""illegal."" Unless a biological, freak accident turns Asians into whites it is hard to believe that the provision will not affect Filipinos. ""Chinese Japanese Koreans and Vietnamese job seekers and employees.


The Demand for Equal Rights


The only way to alter the repressive character of the Simpson-Mazzoli bill is through an active mass movement pressuring the Congress to grant full rights for all immigrants. A united effort is important not only in an immediate sense to defeat the bill, but also to build a stable and politically mature movement that lasts beyond this particular battle.


The building of a movement is easier said than done, when we look at the bitter and protracted struggle against the repression of the state and the depth of the anti-immigrant chauvinism and racism in U.S. society. But such a movement -- that calls for opposition to the Simpson-Mazzoli bill, that fights for equal rights for all immigrants, that supports the struggle against racism and national discrimination -- is imperative.


The Asian community, built on the backs of immigrants, should be in the forefront of the defense of immigrant rights.

Even heart surgery can't stop Min Yasui.


Although still recovering from an operation just six weeks ago, and looking a little thin and tired, the 67-year-old chairman of the National Japanese American Citizens League Committee for Redress has plenty of fight in his voice.


Yasui, somewhat a legend in the Japanese American community, has been fighting for redress nearly all his adult life.


""I'm still fighting mad yet,"" Yasui said assuredly after a recent talk in Portland.


Yasui is no stranger to Portland.


As a young lawyer in 1942, Yasui was arrested in Portland and jailed there for nine months, giving him the odd distinction of being one of the few Japanese Americans still on the West Coast at the time -- even if he was languishing in the Multnomah County Jail.


In protest, Yasui had purposely violated a wartime curfew law aimed specifically at Japanese Americans to test the law's constitutionality. He fought his conviction all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court and lost.


After nine months in jail, Yasui was moved to the Minidoka camp in the sage-brush desert of Southern Idaho. ""I spent about two years in and out of the camps."" he said.


Later he moved to Denver, outside the geographic internment area, to practice law. Although he passed the Colorado State Bar exam with flying colors, the Bar refused to admit him, ostensibly because of his brush with the law in Portland. The State Supreme Court of Colorado eventually admitted Yasui to the Bar:


Yasui did not settle down to a quiet life, however. Instead, he fought for redress.


Earlier this year, in a culmination of ""4,000 hours of research by a corps of volunteer Sansei attorneys in Oakland,"" Yasui said, he Fred Korematsu and Gordon Hirabayashi (imprisoned on similar charges) filed suit in three different federal courts to have their 40-year-old convictions vacated. They charge that the Department of Justice suppressed evidence.


""We're not sure but we think the timing is right,"" Yasui said.


""One of the judges is going to say the evacuation was not a military necessity but a failure of political leadership and racism,"" he predicted. ""That would destroy the legal basis for saying the evacuation was constitutional. That's our hope.""


Hirabayashi's case, filed in Seattle has been assigned to Judge Donald Voorhees. No hearing date has been set.


While waiting for the three controversial cases to have another day in court, Yasui has been drumming up support for redress.


In Portland two weeks ago to attend a class reunion. Yasui took time to fill in the local JACL chapter about the progress of redress legislation in Congress.


His assessment was brutal.


""The tremendous work on the West Coast is not going to be enough"" to get redress legislation passed in Congress. Yasui told a mainly Nisei audience in the basement of the P. . . . Buddhist Church.


Yasui, an eloquent public speaker said the main problem confronting redress advocates is educating Senators and Representatives.


""The major part of this battle is going to have to be won in the Midwest, South, and East Coast,"" he said. Congressmen from the West generally support the redress movement.


Yasui drove home his point with some uncomfortable statistics?


""Of 435 House members, 351 live east of the Rockies. Of 100 Senators, 82 live east of the Western states. The Midwest is one-third of the Senate and one-third of the House. We cannot ignore the South, for there too the bulk of power lies.""


""Redress doesn't stand a chance,"" Yasui said, without a united front from the Nikkei delegation -- Reps. Norm Mineta, D-Calif., and Robert Matsui, D. Calif., and Sens. Daniel Inouye. D-Hawaii and Spark Matsunaga, D-Hawaii -- and without support of House and Senate leadership.


House majority leader Jim Wright, D-Texas, has agreed to sponsor redress legislation, Yasui said, and, the four Nikkei members have agreed to support one bill.


The JACL is now dratting a redress bill it hopes Wright will sponsor.


The first bill tossed into the hopper was submitted by Rep. Mike Lowry. D-Seattle. It would grant $20,000 to each internment camp survivor.


""Money is symbolic and symbolic only,"" Yasui declared, yet it is a necessary part of any redress bill. ""If the price tag is big enough, it is less likely an act like the internment will be done again.""


At this time, any bill that would allow heirs, to collect reparations would be defeated, Yasui told the audience.


""It's always a problem. Do you support the practical or go for the ideal.""


The JACL redress committee which Yasui heads decided to go for the practical at a ""soul searching"" meeting in San Francisco July 9. It decided not to formally endorse reparations for heirs, but the issue was not abandoned. Instead, a wait-and-see position was adopted -- maybe something could be worked out at the Congressional committee level, it suggested.


Since only about 60,000 of approximately 120,000 internees are still alive, maybe Congress will delay five or 10 years and fewer people will be left,"" Yasui suggested. Seventy to 80 percent of Issei internees are already deceased, he said.


Yasui, a Republican refused to give up on possible White House support for redress. He noted that President Reagan ""has explicitly not made any public statement about redress, and as governor of California he ""recognized Japanese American contributions to society.""


While acknowledging, President Reagan's terrible civil rights record. Yasui said, ""Here's a chance to remedy a very bad decision made by a Democratic President.


Yasui answered some common objections to redress. . .


""I keep hearing about the blacks and the Indians Well the whole war on poverty for which billions of dollars were expended was primarily for poor blacks and poor whites. There will be billions more spent on Indian American claims.


""I keep hearing, Why should future generations be saddled with a debt of 40 years ago? As long as the U.S. government exists, obviously you've got to keep paying your debts.""


It has been over 40 years since Executive Order 9066. There is no time limit,"" Yasui said. It took the Sioux 60 years to get their claims settled -- we've only been at it 40 years.""

Editor's Note: The following is a statement issued by the Philippine Solidarity Network and the Coalition Against the Marcos Dictatorship.


In the wake of former Senator Benigno Aquino's assassination, hundreds of people in the U.S. both from within the Filipino communities and the broader public, have echoed the outrage of the Filipino people. The political assassination of Aquino has led the Philippine Solidarity Network and the Coalition Against the Marcos Dictatorship to spearhead protest actions and to participate in vigils, masses and community forums in major cities throughout the U.S. and Canada.


At this time, we would like to appeal to the Filipino community and the Asian community as a whole to voice opposition to the assassination of Senator Aquino as well as the continued repression of the Filipino people both in the Philippines and in the U.S. We urge individuals and organizations to write Congressional representatives demanding the Following.


End all U.S. support to the Marcos regime. There can be no normal relations with the dictatorship. Reagan should cancel his visit to the Philippines this November.


Expel all Marcos agents and spies. Discard the Extradition Treaty between the U.S. and the Philippines.

The funeral of Benigno Aquino turned out to be the largest outpouring of antidictatership sentiment the Philippines has ever seen. Two million people crammed the streets of Manila, braving monsoon rains as well as President Ferdinand Marcos open threats of repression, to bid farewell to a martyr of the struggle against fascist tyranny. Marchers shouted the popular slogan. Marcos Hitler Diktador, Tuta."" Placards read ""Marcos, Imelda, Ver killers on the loose,"" and ""May the killers of Ninoy rest in peace -- soon!""


Throughout the 10 days prior to the funeral Filipinos aired their outrage against this latest Marcos crime. At the University of the Philippines, 3,500 students demonstrated chanting ""No reconciliation with the fascist regime and continue the struggle for freedom and democracy.


When Aquino's body was brought to his hometown in Tarlac one million people crowded the 70 mile route from Manila to his hometown. Another million showed up when the body was brought back to Manila. To the Filipino people, it was clear who was responsible for Aquino's murder and why.


Despite this outpouring of anti-dictatorship sentiments both in the Philippines and internationally, the U.S. government continues to support the fascist regime. With $900 million in U.S. aid, the dictatorship is assured that it can continue repressing the Filipino people's just cause for genuine freedom and democracy. Despite strong newspaper editorials and Congressional protest, Reagan has not indicated that he will cancel his trip to the Philippines in November. In fact, the Reagan administration seems willing to accept the outcome of Marcos rigged ""investigation"" into Aquino's assassination. Moreover, it has justified continued support for the dictatorship because of the importance of the U.S. bases to American national security interests.


It is from that the U.S. which prides itself on instituting democracy in the Philippines, today supports the suppression of the Filipino people's democratic rights. This support has led to the death of 60,000 people over the past 10 years. Filipinos would rather have American taxpayers money go toward the improvement of life in the U.S. -- school lunches, aid for the elderly, equal opportunity programs and other social services -- rather than the destruction of life and property in the Philippines. Both in the U.S. and in the Philippines, support for the Marcos regime does not benefit the majority.


This dictatorial regime, in fact, has extended its repression to the U.S. A secret document, from the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), reveals the arrival of a team of five Philippine agents in 1982, whose goal was to help manage Marcos' visit to the U.S., try to expand ties between the Philippine Embassy and the U.S. State Department of Defense and monitor, anti-Marcos Philippine activists in the U.S. According to the document, these military attaches would undoubtedly report on, and possible operate against, anti-Marcos activists in the U.S.


A day after this document surfaced two former State Department officials volunteered information that, five years ago, the U.S. intercepted messages from Manila to Philippine agents in the U.S. ordering them to harass Marcos opponents. That the U.S. with full knowledge of this, allowed Philippine agents to operate against anti-Marcos activists exposes another angle of U.S. support for the dictatorship. The Committee for Justice for Domingo and Viernes had alleged that Gene Viernes and Silme Domingo, two labor leaders and anti-Marcos activists, were murdered as a result of complicity by both the U.S. and Phlippine governments.


To those in the Asian community who do not want their hard earned tax monies to go to prop up the Marcos regime, we urge you to write your congressional representatives asking for:


an end to U.S. support for Marcos, The cancellation of Reagan's visit to the Philippines in November.


The expulsion of all Marcos agents and spies in the U.S. The abrogation of the U.S. Philippine Extradition Treaty.

The assassination of Philippine Senator Benigno Aquino while under the custody of government troops two months ago appears to be a calculated political move initiated by the Marcos government.


Given the worsening economic and political situation in the Philippines, the regime could not afford to have Aqumo stir the already unstable political arena. The government invented plots of assassination. But Aquino could not be dismayed. He had his own political ambition. He appeared to be the best bet of the Reagan administration in the event that Marcos is junked by the U.S. So in a move that can be likened to a well-rehearsed drama, the regime decided to assassinate Aquino during his homecoming.


The idea that Marcos, a calculating politician, would not order, much less consent to, such a heinous crime simply has no basis. It would have been more difficult for Marcos if Aquino had been given the chance to organize the legal opposition. Thus, killing Aquino was the lesser evil for the regime.


Imelda Marcos, groomed to succeed her husband benefitted from the assassination because it removed one of the stumbling blocks to her . . ..


General Fabian Ver, Chief of staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines once again proved his loyalty to the regime by insuring that the plan was executed with military precision.


And because of Reagan's unqualified support for Marcos, despite his decision to postpone his November visit to the Philippines, the United States is equally guilty in many ways. U.S. military assistance accounts for the regime's existence. U.S. aid has helped the regime beet up the armed forces that for 11 years now have cracked down on anti-dictatorship elements both in the Philippines and in the U.S.


Thus, the death of Aquino is not the first killing the regime is guilty of. It is only the latest of many violent killings that probably will not be solved.


Consider the Jabidah massacre in 1969 the Labor Day massacre of May 1, 1971 the kidnapping of former government apologist Primitive Mijares, the assassination of tribal leader . . . Dulag in . . . 1980 the Dact massacre in June, 1981, the Las Navas Samar massacre in September 1981, the . . . of Dr. Bobby de la Paz in April, 1982, Ed Jopson in September 1982, and Dr. Johnny Escandor in March, 1983.


The list is incomplete for it does not include many Filipino workers, students, professionals and church leaders slain by government right-wing squads trained by U.S. military advisers.


As massive demonstrations, sometimes violent continue to rock the streets of Manila and some provincial capitals, two major differing views have emerged in the ranks of many Filipinos.


One view is that national reconciliation is possible under the present regime as espoused by Aquino.


The other view is that Aquino's assassination although Aquino had been working for national reconciliation closed this option under the present state of affairs.


Recent developments in the Philippines seem to indicate that the Marcos government has not shown it is sincere about national reconciliation.


On the contrary, the regime has reacted with deception and repression even before Aquino was buried.


On orders from Malacanang presidential palace, coverage of Aquino's assassination and funeral were glossed over in the government controlled media. News reports and pictures of the assassination were censored. TV stations were mute. Eines of radio stations were jammed. According to reports a two-page article on Aquino in the Panorama Magazine (Sept. 4 issue) was pulled out even after 35,000 copies had already been printed.


Only recently government soldiers raided and shut down the tabloid Philippine Times for suggesting that the Marcos regime was involved in the murder. The editor was arrested.


Appearing on TV, Marcos warned demonstrators that riot police would be armed. Sofar 12 people have died as a result of demonstrations. Hundreds have been wounded. Scores are in jail.


And in a move that in the past has always embarrassed the regime because of its crudeness. Marcos continues to blame the Communist Party of the Philippines for killing Aquino.


Marcos scheme is not really new From the imposition of martial law in 1972 to the present Marcos has continued to use deception and repression to silence the opposition. This time however the accumulative growth of strength displayed by Filipinos has rapidly expanded and deepened, even reaching the usually silent business sector. It is clear Marcos actions will be no more than an exercise in futility of a troubled and dying dictator.

This year's election had something for everyone. You had a senatorial race, a vote on U.S. involvement in Central America, a candidate who is the king of Seattle's seafood drive-ins, minority candidates who didn't lose, and probably the most interesting tax assessor's election in the state's history.


United States Senate: This race over-shadowed everything else on the ballot. Daniel J. Evans, the former Governor, ran against Mike Lowry, the present Congressman. Lowry had the support of labor, educators, and minorities, the traditional Democratic voting bloc. Evans had the personal backing of President Reagan, big business, and conservatives, the traditional Republica bloc.


Some Asian American voters supported Lowry, but many Asian Americans probably would have supported Evans if his opponent had been somebody other than Mike Lowry. Evans, as Governor, had a good record of supporting the concerns of the Asian community. The State's Commission on Asian American Affairs was created during his administration. But as good as Evans Asian American record was, Lowry's record was better. Lowry was one of the first in Congress to back reparations for Japanese Americans interned during World War II sponsoring several bills providing reparations.


The media focused on the physical appearance of each candidate: It was said that Evans looked like a United States Senator while Lowry looked like a wild-eyed fanatic. This had nothing to do with any of the issues raised by the campaign. Lowry lost his candidacy for the Senate race, but he did make a difference. Lowry campaigned on his now familiar theme of nuclear disarmament. In the last days of the race, Evans appeared in a television ad, surrounded by his family, stating that he was opposed to war. The one encouraging item from Lowry's loss is that he will still be in Congress. Dan Evans has been a friend of Asian Americans in the past and there's no reason why he won't be now.


Minority Candidates: All the minority candidates who ran for major offices won. Sam Smith, Norm Rice, and Dolores Sibonga easily won re-election in their City Council races. Lloyd Hara was re-elected City Treasurer. Jerry Saulter captured a vacant Seattle School board position. Race was not an issue in any of the campaigns. This may be a first in our city's political history. It had been predicted before the primaries that Dolores Sibonga would face a strong challenge from Frank Doolittle, who reportedly had the backing of such political luminaries as former Seattle Mayor Wes Uhlman and Mayor Charles Royer. But Doolittle did little as Sibonga handily won the primary and general election. Lloyd Hara, who had faced adverse publicity earlier this year, won against a candidate who had vowed to abolish the office both were seeking. Norm Rice ran against the ""Laser Party"" candidate and didn't even bother to campaign. Sam Smith made token campaign appearances. Of the minority candidates, Jerry Saulter had the closest political race, running against Greg Nickels for the School Board position vacated by Patt Sutton. Saulter had the backing of the Alki Foundation and conservative groups, while Nickels, considered a liberal, had the backing of the Democratic Party. Minority support went to both candidates.


Other Races: The International District lost an important ally when Jack Richards lost his City Council seat to Jim Street. Richards, endorsed by several Asian community leaders had become a strong supporter of the District. Street was another of the younger Democratic liberals making names for themselves. His record on the District remains to be established.


The king of Seattle's seafood drive-ins; Ivar Haglund, proved that having name familiarity was more important than having a track record on the issues. His approach to the issues was to keep clam. Henry Kotkins didn't have a chance. Ivar really didn't have to advertise. It's pretty hard to drive around Seattle without running into an Ivar's restaurant. When it comes to Port Commission races, most people don't have the knowledge to make an informed choice.


And then there was the Tax Assessor's race. Harley Hoppe has in recent years been the kind of politician that you either intensely liked or hated. In a way, folks will miss Harley Hoppe like they missed Richard Nixon. Harley Hoppe made the Tax. Assessor's office interesting. Without taking away anything from Ruthe Ridder, the successful candidate, news about the Tax Assessor's office will probably get buried again in the back pages. In this race, mud slinging became an art of some sort.


Some political observers called these elections an indicator of support for Ronald Reagan and his policies. But aside from Dan Evans, Republicans and conservatives didn't fare well in local area politics. The initiative dealing with United States involvement in Central America had Seattle folks saying Get out."" This election did have a higher turn out than usual for an off-presidential year. Next year's election will be the true test of support for Ronald Reagan and his policies.

Before I received an invitation in September to visit Nicaragua, I, like most Americans, knew very little about this Central American country.


Now, after seven intensive days of traveling through Nicaragua, visiting the barrios and talking with the leaders and plain folks. I know a little more about that country and a lot more about, our own country.


I visited Nicaragua as a member of a delegation of 21 persons, including a crew from KING-TV headed by Bob Simmons. Some observers branded our group a leftwing support operation, others thought of us as a tourist-oriented fun group, but presence of the TV crew must have legitimized the fact-finding tour, which was what we really were.


We left Sea-Tac Airport on November 1 at 11 p.m., flying all night to Atlanta. We arrived in Managua from Miami in 85 degree spring weather and were met, as we disembarked from the plane, by the first lady of Nicaragua, Rosario Murillo, and a national network television crew. After welcoming remarks by Rosario, we were taken by bus to the Memorial of Carlos Fonceca Amador, the founder of the Sandinista Front for National Liberation (FSCN), the ruling political party which coordinated the 1979 revolution.


The following day was spent in the capital city of Managua, speaking with city leaders including the mayor, Samuel Santos. When I told him my father and brother shared his name, he insisted that we must be related.


The delegation spent the better part of three days touring the reconstruction projects throughout the city of Managua which was virtually destroyed by the earthquake of 1972. We learned that even though money, food and equipment was sent to this devastated country, very little got through to the people in need and nothing went toward reconstruction of the capital city. It was said that former dictator Somoza, in power then, diverted the aid to his personal use. The people in the barrios said they were forced to purchase the foodstuffs sent to them from our country as well as from other countries.


The city's resources are now being used to build a new infrastructure especially in the barrios where the people live, Running water is being piped in, sewers are being laid, street and sidewalk construction is nearing completion and families are rebuilding their own homes, replacing wood and sheet metal siding with concrete construction blocks.


One of the main problems with this developing country is the need to divert much needed resources from reconstruction to defense. Wherever we went, we saw the people training to defend their country from invaders. In the barrios of Managua, the Sandinista Defense Committee (CDS) has organized provisions for health care, food supply the building of shelters, and supplying transportation for evacuation. Key people are trained to assist other people so that everyone knows exactly what to do in the event of any emergency, including an invasion or all-out war.


We witnessed defense preparations all the way to the northern border, where the CIA-trained and equipped counter-revolutionaries or Contras as they are called have attacked many villages from their Honduras-based camps.


We visited the village of Pantazama where 47 military personal and civilians were massacred just two weeks before our arrival. This is the area where coffee beans grow, and the goal of the Contras is to destroy the coffee at harvest time thereby affecting the national economy. But the people of this small village beat back the invaders even though they were outnumbered three to one.


We had been told by our government through the media, that equipment and arms had been provided by Russia and Cuba. But after close scrutiny, I found that many of the trucks, tractors and arms were also manufactured by East Germany, West Germany, Taiwan, Spain, Holland and other European countries.


It is a fact that after the revolution of 1979, the leaders of the country requested aid from the U.S. in the form of equipment, technology and arms, but were denied by the Reagan administration. It is also a fact that the Carter administration offered Nicaragua a $50 million loan which was cancelled by the Reagan administration.


We keep reading and hearing about a Russian and Cuban build-up and a communist threat, but what we never heard or read was that this country had been invaded by the U.S. Marines 14 times since 1847. In those early years, invasion was carried out under the Monroe Doctrine and the idea of manifest destiny. Today, it's just a plain ""communist threat."" Nicaraguans reflect that they have struggled for peace and self determination for 136 years and are not willing to accept intervention from the U.S. let alone Russia and Cuba.


The present government, the Sandinista Front for National Liberation (FSLN), is made up of representatives who are Marxist, Catholic (including several Catholic priests). Socialists and others of a democratic persuasion. The leaders are young, very intelligent, but feel they are not accepted as equals by the U.S. administration. A prime example is the attitude of some of our prestigious diplomats who were appointed by President Reagan to the Kissinger Commission studying the problems in Central America. When visiting Nicaragua the Commission staff set up the agenda for the meetings, which became the cause for a walk-out by Nicaraguan officials. The officials believed that as the host nation they had the right and responsibility to set the 'agenda.' The Commission finally agreed and the meetings were held.


An incident at the meeting raised questions about the sincerity of the individual . . . members. One commission member reported that when Commandante Daniel Ortega, the spokesman for the ruling Junta presented his statement another commission member passed a note to Kissinger which said. ""Do we have to listen to this SOB?"" This attitude only reinforces the image that too many developing countries have towards the leaders of our country and our famous ""gunboat diplomacy.""


The people we talked with support the revolutionary government, are very knowledgeable about international politics love their country and will defend it at all costs. Much like we should do if anyone tried to invade our shores.

Benigno S. Aquino, Jr. gained national prominence for the first time as a teenage Manila Times reporter in the frontlines of the Korean War Subsequently, in his early twenties, he became the mayor of his hometown, Concepcion, Tarlac.


As mayor and then as Tarlac governor, he adopted a populist style and endeared himself to many people. Although he belonged to a landlord family, he knew how to befriend and relate himself positively to the peasants and even to the armed revolutionaries.


As senator, he often took a progressive liberal stand on outstanding issues involving national independence and democracy. He sympathized on many occasions with the democratic cause of workers, peasants, students, youth, teachers and other people.


He advocated the solution of basic social problems and opposed Philippine involvement in the Vietnam War and the brutality of the military and police againt the outburst of mass demonstrations that came to be called the First Quarter Storm of 1970 as well as other mass actions in the 1970-1972 period. He was an outstanding opponent of the Marcos regime, especially with regard to its propensity to use terror and violence against the people.


Aquino stood courageously against the rising trend of fascism under the U.S.-backed Marcos regime, marked by unwarranted assaults on unarmed demonstrators and massacres such as the Plaza. Miranda bombing of 1971. Marcos blamed the bombing on the Communist Party of the Philippines and Aquino, but the people did not believe him. The Liberal Party swept the elections, with Aquino topping the senatorial slate. He became even more clearly the front-running presidential hopeful in 1973.


But Marcos was cold-bloodedly fabricating incidents, especially bombings, and creating the conditions for the declaration of martial law in 1972 and for grabbing all governmental powers for himself. When fascist dictatorship began. Aquino was not only robbed of the chance to become president but was also arbitrarily arrested and detained on trumped-up charges. He was in solitary confinement for almost seven years.


As had been expected. Aquino was railroaded to a death sentence together with other patriots. This act of injustice aroused not only the just anger of the people but also the serious concern of major governments. Appeals were made on his behalf. Marcos had to backtrack, granting a retrial and cajoling him to give credence to the Interim Batasan Pambansa elections in 1978 by running as an opposition candidate. Of course, he was cheated in the rigged elections.


In prison, he suffered a heart attack in 1980 but was deprived of proper medical care for more than a month. Only after erroneously estimating that Aquino would die or become an invalid did Marcos allow him to leave for the United States. After Aquino's successful heart operation, Marcos explicitly allowed him to stay abroad to keep him out of the country. At the same time, Marcos tried to discredit Aquino as reneging on a promise to return.


As soon as his passport lapsed in 1982. Aquino asked for renewal but was refused to the very end. Not even entreaties through Marcos' wife Imelda could persuade Marcos to allow the renewal of Aquino's passport. Both Marcos and his wife were discouraging Aquino from returning to the country because supposedly his enemies were out to kill him.


After years in exile, Aquino developed an intense and sincere desire to return to his country to help work for democratization and to rebuild his political party and participate in the broad opposition. He wanted Marcos to dismantle his own fascist dictatorship and reconcile himself with the people whom his regime has intensively exploited and oppressed for an excessively long time.


Aquino knew very well that Marcos was capable of having him assassinated. But why did he still return? He had to make a choice between being killed in the United States like Primitivo Mijares without proof of Marcos' responsibility or being killed in his own country with proof of Marcos responsibility.


In the U.S., Aquino was in a dilemma. He was already being treated as an illegal alien and deprived of adequate protection. Not close to the high officials of the Reagan administration and with only a few friends and sympathizers within the U.S. Congress and U.S. State Department, he was not yet in any position of starting to erode the illegitimate power of the regime.


The retention of absolute powers is a matter of life and death for Marcos. He reacted violently to the tactful suggestion of U.S. Congressmen that the pending $900 million appropriation called for by the U.S.-Philippine Military Base Agreement would be rearranged (the military component being reduced in favor of the economic component) if Marcos did not ease his grip on the country and allow Aquino to return. Thus, Marcos' murderous hatred of Aquino reached a new peak when Aquino insisted on his right to return home.


Aquino sacrificed his life. But he triumphed. He succeeded in demonstrating the injustice and madness of the fascist puppet regime and the need for the people to overthrow it. The Aquino assassination is one despicable crime where there is no ambiguity about the responsibility of the fascist regime.

The new King County Affirmative Action Administrator wants to ""strengthen community input"" into the decisions made by his office, and hopes to include community people with concerns about affirmative action policy on the County's Affirmative Action Advisory Committee.


Alan Momohara, who became Affirmative Action Administrator for the County on July 25 after eight and a half years in the Federal Office of Civil Rights, said the County's Affirmative Action Program has four areas of responsibility In addition to equal employment opportunities for minorities and women within County government, the program handles fair housing rights cases for residents in unincorporated King County, enforces the County's year-old Minority Women Business Enterprse (M/WBE) Ordinance, and investigates, monitors and certifies contractors with the County to ensure they meet contract compliance requirements.


The former Deputy Regional Director of the local Office of Civil Rights said he left the security of a federal government position for several reasons. ""Given the direction I saw the Reagan administration was taking in civil rights. I didn't feel I wanted to be a part of that program,"" he Office of Civil Rights as an investigator in 1974 and served as temporary Regional Director of the New York Office of Civil Rights for one year until November 1981, said it is easy to become trapped in the federal bureaucracy. ""I guess I was kind of stagnating,"" he explained. ""I had a choice of either lying there or taking new challenges. I was lucky; not everybody can get out.


Momohara is a Seattle native who attended Bailey Gatzert Elementary School and Garfield High School. After graduating from the University of Washington, he received a master's degree in political science from Western Washington State College and taught at Green River Community College before joining the Office of Civil Rights.


Interviewed during his first budget writing process. Momohara said he is happier working in a position where he has more direct control over the office even though having to convince the County Council that what he is asking for is important to the County is a ""different experience"" For him. ""At least the rate my hair is turning color has decreased,"" he said.


""Ultimately my goal is to make this the best program in the state."" Momohara explained. ""We have a young Minority Women Business Enterprise Ordinance."" he said, and there have been some mistakes, but Momohara hopes to make the County M/WBE ordinance the most effective by the end of next year.


Another of Momohara's goals is to increase the number of handicapped County employees Currently only about 1.6 percent of the County semployees are handicapped. ""Most sources say we should be at about nine or ten percent. . . . explained.


Momohara has asked for an increase in his staff in the area of fair housing -- from a part-time to a full-time position -- in next year's budget because he feels information about what the office can do is not getting out. In areas of the County outside of city or town boundaries; the Affirmative Action Office can act on any violation of the fair housing ordinance such as discrimination by an apartment owner real estate agent or bank. ""There's just a lot of different things we can do that people don't realize. Momohara explained.


Momohara wants to redraft the ordinance that established the Affirmative Action Advisory Committee to include community people on the committee. The seventeen member committee currently contains five County employees an employee from the City of Seattle's Office of Human Rights and an employee of the Office of Personnel in the federal government. Momohara said when the committee was established it dealt solely with internal County employment. But because the County Affirmative Action Program is responsible for the M/WBE ordinance fair housing and contract compliance, he feels the committee should include people from the community who have concerns about at-firmative action.


In seeking to increase community input. Momohara invites people to contact his office. ""Tell us what you think There's always room for improvement.

The best part of traveing is not necessarily how many cities you visit of how many museums and exhibits you see or what kind of souvenirs you pick up along the way. The most memorable part of traveling is the conversations you have with people of the country you visit.


This summer I had the opportunity to travel to Europe. Though I spent time on the usual itinerary of museums, historical sights, and shops, much of my time was spent in parks listening to the locals and talking with British friends of my traveing companion who had previously lived in the country. Thoughts on politics, social customs, and philosophy kept us up until the early hours of the morning.


It is easy to focus on our differences and view our situation as unique. Through my conversation with these friends, particularly a high school mathematics teacher. Howard Gilbert, I discovered that concerns about education, government, and the quality of life are strikingly similar.


This article will be the first of three articles comparing and contrasting American and English society. This first piece will focus on the public school system in England. The next two articles will cover social and political issues, customs and language.


Like our public schools, the county or public schools in England are maintained and operated by the state through local school boards. However, our education system differ. The English system consists of first school, middle school, secondary school and sixth form college.


Children begin school at age five, entering first school. Depending on where you live in the country, the child will attend first school until the age of nine or ten. Then the student will enter middle school for two years, then proceed to secondary school.


Secondary schools are comprehensive, meaning they take children of all abilities and offer a variety of course work. Years ago after middle school and a series of tests students were enrolled in either grammar school which was college preparatory, secondary modern which provided a more general education or technical school which was vocation-oriented.


Students spend five years in secondary school. In the fifth year, students take an examination called ordinary level, more commonly referred to as ""O"" levels. ""O"" levels are split into two grouper those in the top 25 percent take the General Certificate Examination or GCE, and the remainder take what is called the Certification Secondary Examination or CSE. After these exams and completion of the fifth year, a student may legally leave the school system.


If the student wishes to continue his or her education, sixth form college is the next and final step. Depending on where one lives, the student will either continue at the same school or go to a separate sixth form college.


In this school, there are two grades called lower sixth and upper sixth. During the upper sixth, students are again subjected to an examination called advanced or ""A"" levels. These exams are critical as they determine not only whether the student will be accepted into the university of his or her choice but whether they will be accepted to any . . . versity at all.


Students are allowed to choose three subjects to be tested on. These exams may consist of any there from one to five essays. Every higher education institution sets minimum standards for acceptance into their institution and they are based on the results of the ""A"" level . . . All other factors are . . . relevant.


There are three types of higher education institutions. First, there are universities which are strictly academic-oriented These would include Oxford and Cambridge University at the top of the . . . Second there are polytechnics Universities stress academics, whereas poly-technics stress application. Engineering and computer students are common here. Finally, there are colleges which cover a wider range of subjects. Essentially students learn a trade such as cooking or catering. Once a student decides on which university polytechnic, or college to attend, the choice is . . . Transterring to another . . .


After hearing a . . . of this examination process, and after actually watching the reaction of a young woman receive her ""A"" level exam results I found that while the exams might be an effective way of getting the top students into the top universities, it was also a strenuous path through academia. Everything seemed so final, so critical, so inflexible. If one makes a costly mistake in this academic pursuit, the opportunity to continue one's education could be eliminated.


I asked Howard, as an educator, what he though of this examination system. The exams are essentially aimed at finding the top students. Because the examstend to stress what the child doesn't know as opposed to what the child does know they can be very damaging to student egos. After finding out time after time that one is below average, a child can become so demoralized that he or she may give up. This not only creates discipline problems but motivation . . . as well.


Although preparation for exams may breed discipline and responsibility, one cannot help but notice the amount of pressure on some one that young. We of ten forget that these students are still teen-agers developing their abilities and self-esteem.


Approximately 90 percent of . . . children attend county schools. The remainder attend private or voluntary schools. As in the United States, the differences between public and private schools tend to . . . controversy . . . the Labor Pary. which has more liberal members views education as a . . . not a privilege. The Party feels education should be equally available to everyone, regardless of economic and social background. The Labor Party believes private schools violate this principle. Some members even prefer to abolish private schools. On the other hand, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and the Conservative Party view private schools as an alternative means of education. They believe private schools provide the right to choose the type of education a child . . .


Incidentally, like President Reagan's plan to give . . . whose children attend private school. Thatcher had a similar proposal where a . . . and would be implementer, . . . would be given . . . come to use to pay . . .


When comparing the Peagan . . . fration and the Thatcher Administration one finds many similarities in the . . . education. Thatcher's economic strategy is a massive reduction in public spending This strategy has directed her cuts in education.


It is not surprising that the United States and England share similar problems in education. In England, class sizes have increased teachers are being asked to teach subjects they aren't trained to teach, non-teaching staff are being let go forcing teachers to spend more time on administrative matters rather than concentrating on teaching books and equipment are becoming outdated, teachers aren't being replaced and morale is low . . . teachers.


Again, as in the United States education and the teaching protession have come under cmticism Americans tend to glorify the soundness of the British . . . system and praise them for their attention to basics. Some of the praise may be . . . but one micht be . . . know that the same . . . for not producing students . . . standards in reading . . . matics.


It is difficult . . . rigidity of the English . . . the Americans. In England . . . pressure to do well in exams so they can continue the education et al one . . . a top university. In . . . relative lack of pressure on . . . prepare themselves . . . and attend a high . . . spite the difference between our two systems it appears that educators and parents in both countries are annappy with the way the education system is presently operating and current administration policies toward education.

The dentist sits on the bunk shining his shoes for the next day's appointments in a nearby village. After practicing his trade for the poor people in the village, he will return to his bunk in a dormatory, set in a prison farm an hour's drive from Managua. The dentist is on work release, even though he received a maximum prison term of 26 years for his role as a high ranking official in the repressive Somoza regime before the revolution in 1979.


Most of the 120 prisoners on this farm were members of Somoza's dreaded National Guard. The Sandinistas, the ruling political party which coordinated the 1979 revolution, eliminated the death penalty in 1979 and sentenced a number of political prisoners to serve from five to 26 year terms at prisons and honor farms. The prisoners on this farm are permitted conjugal rights with their wives on weekends and can also earn furloughs home once every month. Although there are guards, they are not armed, and there are no bars or fences to discourage escape.


Besides constructing and expanding the prison buildings, the prisoners keep busy raising livestock and maintaining the farms banana crop. All the inmates were friendly open and vocal in their opinion of the revolution. Not all agreed with the present leadership and government, but there didn't seem to be hostility toward their captors.


The revolutionary government is planning to release hundreds of Misquito Indians from prisons because the Sandinista leadership feels that they had been forced to support the Somoza regime without full knowledge of the political consequences.


We met two Catholic nuns from the United States -- Sister Nancy Donovan and Sister Mary Hartman -- who left a profound memory for me. Nancy Donovan a Maryknoll sister, lives in a village 60 miles northwest of Esteli. She had seen Roberto Maestas, a member of our delegation, on Nicaragua's national television network when he was being interviewed at the airport the day we arrived. She had met Roberto a year ago when she visited El Centro de la Raza where he serves as executive director. She shared with us her experiences with the country and the people she had come to love.


Sister Donovan helps the people with the daily struggles of life, teaching and sharing her Christian faith with the people.


Her village near the border is flanked by two roads which the CIA-backed counter-revolutionaries (Contras) use on their ""destroy missions"" from Honduras into Nicaragua. Sister Donovan says the Contras, passing through the village force young teenagers to serve as porters and perform subservient tasks. The people of this northern region, she says, fear the imminent danger of an all-out invasion.


Sister Donovan traveled with us that afternoon to the town of Esteli where we were guests of the ASTC (Sandinista Association of Cultural Workers) which was sponsoring a youth conference attended by several thousand young people from throughout the country. We heard a half dozen speeches from local politicans guests and youth leaders, and we were entertained by revolutionary chants and songs honoring past national heroes.


After all the festivities, we dropped Sister Donovan off on a deserted street not far from a convent. She waved good-bye, clutching her overnight bag. I couldn't help but think that she was fulfilling the true mission of her church No banners, no chants, no songs, just this beautiful person working with everyday people, who had everyday problems, living in an everyday war zone.


Sister Mary Hartman is director of the Commission for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights based in Managua. She was very direct in her assessment that our government has tried to impose its values on Nicaragua. She was very outspoken in her belief that the religious persecution in Nicaragua today occurs at the hands of the Catholic hierarchy, not at the hands of the revolutionary junta. She and other clergy have fought openly with the archbishop of Managua. Miguel Obando y Bravo, who has organized opposition to the government from within the church. Although the biggest national holiday is All Souls Day which is celebrated on November 2, the archbishop banned the celebration of any mass or religious ceremony honoring those who died in the country's revolution.


Sister Hartman estimated that the religious community is split 60 to 40 percent in favor of the government in the cities, and 80 to 20 percent in favor of the government in the rural farm counties.


I spoke with two people who weren't too crazy about the revolution. Richard Thornton, an American with a distinct Southern drawl and an ever present Nicaraguan cigar (""not quite as good as Cuban cigars"") says he supported Somoza and still thinks the revolution was a mistake. He has owned the Hotel Ticomo, where we stayed, for 27 years, and was very outspoken against the ruling party. The party, however, still uses his establishment to house its guests. Another man we met at a local night club who was from Costa Rica, talked glowingly of Somoza. He also admired Ronald Reagan and another courageous American, General George Custer.


Everywhere we stopped, we were surrounded by young people who asked, ""Why do the Yankees want to invade Nicaragua?"" Aurelio, a 14-year-old, stated simply, ""Since our country changed its political system with new leadership, the U.S. wants to invade us. But when the U.S. changed its political system with new leadership, Nicaragua didn't plan an invasion of the U.S.""


Our trip was coordinated by members of the Seattle-Managua Sister City Association. Although Managua has not been officially designated a sister city, there are negotiations underway between members of the Association and Seattle Mayor Charles Royer's office to expedite an official sanction.


Managua Mayor Samuel Santos is not unlike Charles Royer: both are young dashing and eloquent. Santos, a member of the junta for the reconstruction of Managua, wore an olive colored uniform and, of course, had his revolver holstered on his hip.""


We were surprised that our delegation had access to the top leaders of the country. We attended everyday meetings with ministers of Health, the Interior, Defense and Education; and we were able to attend functions featuring the leaders of the Junta, including Father Ernesto Cardenal, Minister of Culture, Sergio Ramirez Mercado and Cordova Ravas.


Our last evening in Managua, Rosario Murillo, Nicaragua a first lady, hosted a dinner reception where she presented the delegation with crafts made by local artists. Rosario herself is an internationally famous poet.


The highlight of the trip was a presentation that same evening by the Commander of the Junta, Daniel Ortega. Ortega, who met with us late that evening for over an hour, stated: ""We do not want war, but the U.S. has continually intervened in our national affairs and has invaded Nicaragua several times in the past two centuries, hence, we are now forced to prepare ourselves to face a similar action, but we will also make all possible efforts to prevent this from happening.


Although obviously tired from the tremendous strain he was under with his country threatened by invasion from three sides, he did remain to recerve gifts from the delegation and thank us for spending time trying to understand more about the country and the people of Nicaragua.


It would be impossible to write about the people of Nicaragua without writing about the persons who served as our translators, guides, and hosts, Noel Correa, a handsome, energetic young man and former member of the country's consulate staff in San Francisco, is now the Assistant Director of the Cultural Workers Association. He provided invaluable background about the politics of the revolution and the history leading up to it. And there was Margarita Clark, who was raised in Washington D.C., but returned to her mother's homeland after the revolution to apply her medical background for the people in need. As our main translator and guide, she picked us up in the morning, deposited us on our daily excursions, was responsible for our meals and brought us home every evening. All of this on a time schedule that demanded promptness. She caught hell once from Noel for allowing the delegation to shop at the mercado in Managua . . . us to be 25 minutes late for our next appointment. We wanted to explain to him that it was really our fault for being tardy, but she said firmly. The revolution is on time and there are no excuses.""


This brought us back to the reality that we were not a tourist-oriented fun group, but that we had gone to this developing country to learn for durselves what the revolution has done to guarantee self-determination for a country too long controlled by U.S.-supported dictators for U.S.-dominated business interests that controlled the country's economy. The revolution was for the people by the people and not unlike the revolution of 1776 in our own country.

The New Year provides a rare opportunity to wish for the completion of unfinished tasks and to envision new ones. It's time to begin again. It's in this spirit that I wish the following:


-- that all social service agencies helping minority groups be spared from further cuts by the government agencies;


-- that columnist William Hearst, Jr. admit to himself the oppressive nature of the governments of South Korea, the Philippines, Chile, El Salvador, Honduras and not just single out Poland and Afghanistan;


-- that more capable bilingual Asians be appointed to sensitive government positions that provide direct services and assistance to Seattle's Asian communities;


-- that the so-called community leaders of the different Indo-Chinese ethnic groups, whose only advantage is the ability to speak English, don't succumb to the temptation of using community resources for their own advantages;


-- that more and more Americans realize President Reagan's bellicose foreign policy is leading America closer to war;


-- that the existence of Asian gangs in Seattle not be used by the media as a basis for stereotyping Asians;


-- that Seattle School Superintendent Donald Steele and some of the community Black activists settle their differences once and for all and start tackling the problem of inefficient education;


-- that Congressional Representative Mike Lowry continue his campaign for a verifiable nuclear freeze and cuts in defense budget and not emulate Senator Dan Evans who seems to be heavily influenced by Ronald Reagan in almost all of his votes in the Senate;


-- that the International District be made a ""City within a City,"" ala Vatican, and appoint Bob Santos as its official Mayor;


-- that Asians report to proper authorities cases of rape, alcoholism, child abuse and domestic violence;


-- that the world understand how the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank (WB) subtly control and impoverish Third World economies.


-- that the Vatican reveal its findings in the Archbishop Hunthausen investigation;


-- that Mayor Charles Royer, Seattle Police and the Guardian Angels openly and cooperatively discuss how to best combat crime in the city;


-- that TV advertisers not peddle alcohol consumption by showing commercials with famous professional players and personalities;


-- that the Department of Social and Health Services develop a system where clients do not have to wait for almost one hour before being seen by a financial counselor;


-- that the U.S. stop playing the role of ""international policeman"" and leave the poorer nations to choose their own form of government;


-- that job interviewers refrain from asking recent immigrants. ""Do you have local experience?"";


-- that members of the United Nations discuss their objectives in light of the changing political and economic conditions in many parts of the world;


-- that Governor Spellman be commended for his efforts to link the State of Washington with the Far East through tourism and trade;


-- that athletes participating in the 1984 Summer Olympics be spared from unnecessary harm;


-- that the International Examiner remain a community paper, always dedicated to the cause of the Asian community;


-- that all my friends, members of my family and people of good will come to grips with the issue of human rights violations in many parts of the world;


-- and lastly, that people realize the richness of a simple smile!

Approximately 250 members and supporters of the Japanese American Citizens League (JACL) attended the 62nd Annual JACL Installation and Awards Banquet late last month at the Doubletree Plaza at Southcenter.


State Sen. George Fleming, who played a key role winning compensation for Japanese American state employees who lost their jobs during World War II, was the keynote speaker at the banquet. KOMO-TV reporter Marcus Mukai was the master of ceremonies.


""This turnout shows solidarity that flows through your community,"" Fleming said. ""We have all made progress but much progress is yet to be made. In the struggle for full civil rights and liberties, you can be proud.""


But even though Japanese Americans have come this far, Fleming said, they still have not made their presence known in many places, such as in state government.


""There is still a lot to do,"" he said, citing President Reagan's recent attack on affirmative action and the Civil Rights Commission.


""Complet miscarriage of justice is still possible,"" Fleming said. ""Not all of our opponents are bigots, but all bigots are our opponents.""

Cai Zemin, the former Chinese ambassador to the United States says that future U.S.-China relations will proceed ""without much improvement or deterioration"" for some time to come. Cai, who served as ambassador until December 1982, had made four or five trips to Seattle on official business. I met him each time and occasionally served as his on-the-spot interpreter. On my last trip to China in January, 1984, I spent an hour with him in Beijing at the Chinese Institute of Foreign Affairs where he serves as vice president.


The Chinese Institute of Foreign Affairs receives and communicates with official delegates and important visitors from foreign lands. The Institute also arranges China tours for selected foreign groups and accepts invitations for Chinese specialists to go abroad. ""This exchange,"" Mr. Cai explained, ""is very helpful in promoting understanding and friendship between people.""


Mr. Cai looked relaxed and healthy, wearing a western styled brown leather jacket and a broad smile.


Commenting on the future of U.S.-China relations, Mr. Gai stated that it would be a blessing for both countries if the vibrations between the two were positive and strong.


He said however that ""this relationship will proceed for some time without much improvement or deterioration."" Mr. Cai cited a series of political events that occurred successively which delineated the ups and downs of the U.S.-China connection. As I listened to him, I could not come up with anything to disagree with him.


Mr. Cai suggested that Chinese Premier Zhao's visit to the United States in January, followed by President Reagan's trip to China, scheduled for this April, might help the U.S.-China relationship. ""Actually, there was quite a debate in Beijing among the comrades when they discussed about the timing and the desirability of Premier Zhao's proposed trip to the United States,"" he added. ""Some of us suggested that the Premier should not go. Eventually, after all the views were expressed, we concluded that the Premier's visit would have a positive impact overall upon U.S.-China relations. A journey as such would also project a stronger image of China upon other nations....""


Mr. Cai turned to a very delighted and affirmative tone describing the on-going U.S.-China exchange programs. ""Our open door policy will definitely stay,"" he said. ""Nearly 20,000 Chinese scholars, students, and technologists have participated in such exchange programs. About half of them have already finished their assignments and returned home.""


Before departure, I proposed to Ambassador Cai, ""Be sure to come to Seattle when you visit the United States again. You have many friends there who will welcome you.""


""You bet!""

Super Tuesday, March 13, will be a major step in the process of deciding who will challenge Ronald Reagan for the presidency in 1984. On that day, Washington and nine other states will hold caucuses or primary elections to select delegates for the Democratic national convention. It is crucial that Asian and Pacific Americans have a say in that process.


Reagan has been in office for over three years now. It has been no picnic for Asian and Pacific people, other minorities, women or the poor. Domestically, the Reagan administration has tried to give tax breaks to segregated schools; fired most of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission and busted the PATCO union. He has blocked the Equal Rights Amendment; undermined public education; and cut over $110 billion from human services such as food stamps, welfare, and Social Security.""


In foreign policy, we have seen the U.S. use less and less diplomacy and more and more military force to settle social and economic problems in Third World countries. Grenada, Central America and Lebanon are the clearest examples: Reagan has also continued his unquestioned support of the Marcos dictatorship in the Philippines and stepped up U.S. military presence in Micronesia, the South Pacific, Korea and Japan.


All of these actions have direct and indirect impact upon our people and our communities. Four more years -- and they'll be far worse years -- is unthinkable. We must act together now to prevent this country from moving even further to the right. One way to do this is by supporting a candidate in the Democratic caucuses who will really make a difference in standing up for our peoples interests.


Jesse Jackson's candidacy offers the most by far to Asian and Pacific Americans. First, Jackson is best able to speak to issues of greatest concern to Asian and Pacific people.


He opposes the Simpson-Mazzoli immigration reform bill and racist violence against Asians such as occurred in the Vincent Chin case in Detroit. He supports redress for Japanese Americans incarcerated during World War II and bilingual education. Jackson, as a Black candidate, would give higher priority to issues of racial justice.


Second, the Jackson candidacy represents a tremendous push for greater democracy for Blacks in the U.S. -- and this means greater democracy for us all. How can we expect 3 million Asian and Pacific people to enjoy true equality or exercise a fair share of political power if 30 million Black people are denied theirs? So it's crucial that we get involved and not just stand on the sidelines.


Some say Jesse Jackson cannot win. But he cannot lose. Whether he actually wins the Democratic nomination, his campaign will generate a new wave of movement for justice, equality and political power among the poor, the dispossessed, women, people of color -- in short, the vast majority of Americans.


The Democratic Party will not be able to ignore this movement. If we are organized, society as a whole will have to address our concerns in a much more thorough and serious way. And we will all gain from that.


Nationwide, Asian Americans for Jesse Jackson committees are forming in Boston, New York, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. The Jackson campaign has recently appointed a National Coordinator for Asian Americans for Jesse Jackson (AAJJ).


A local group of Asian Americans for Jesse Jackson will meet Saturday, March 10 at 10 a.m. in the Bush-Asia Center meeting room. For more information, call Tom Eng, 322-6476; Bob Santos, 624-1802; or Stan Shikuma, 329-0172.

The fight for Washington's 70 delegate votes at the Democratic national convention begins in earnest on Super Tuesday, March 13, at 8 p.m. At that time, Democrats across the state will meet in precinct caucuses to select delegates representing their presidential candidate and to begin debate on a party platform.


It's called Super Tuesday because 10 states will hold their party caucuses or primary elections all on the same day. In all, more than 600 delegate votes will be up for grabs. Many believe that any candidate who can sweep the 10 states will have the nomination locked up. On the other hand, any candidate who falters badly on that day may be forced from the race.


Five candidates remain in the Democratic race: John Glenn, Gary Hart, Jesse Jackson, George McGovern and Walter Mondale. Whomever wins will face Ronald Reagan in the presidential election this November. All five have campaigns in the Seattle area, and all five are seeking supporters to attend the precinct caucuses on March 13.


In addition to candidates, a local coalition, We the People, is attempting to persuade both parties to adopt a nuclear weapons freeze resolution as part of their party platform. Other groups and individuals may attend the caucuses to push for adoption of their resolutions as well, on issues such as peace in Central America and support for the Equal Rights Amendment.


Anyone who is a resident registered voter in a precinct may vote in the Democratic precinct caucuses, but only in their home precinct. The caucus meetings will start promptly at 8 p.m. on March 13 in each precinct. Meetings are usually held in someone's home or occasionally in a local school or meeting hall. Anyone, whether registered or not, may attend to observe and participate in discussions, though they will not be able to vote.


At the caucus meetings, issues and resolutions for the platform will be discussed and voted on Delegate selection for presidential candidates will be conducted. Based on the number of supporters for each candidate who are present, delegates will be assigned to one or more candidates. It is important to note that the most popular candidates may not get any delegates if his supporters fail to attend these meetings.


The delegates chosen at the precinct caucuses will then proceed to the Legislative District caucuses or a County Convention in April. Again, delegates for candidates will be selected, and they will proceed on to the Congressional District caucuses and the state convention. It is at these meetings that the final decisions on party platform and on Washington's 70 delegates to the national convention will be made.


In order to participate in the process at all you must be registered to vote. This can be done anytime up to 8 p.m. on March 13. Voter registration can be done at any Seattle community center, all Seattle Fire Departments, all branch public libraries, public schools and the King County Administration Building. A variety of organizations -- including churches, We the People, civic organizations, Jesse Jackson for President Committee, League of Women Voters -- will also conduct voter registration drives and set up tables at shopping centers and malls.


If you wish to attend your precinct caucus on March 13, but don't know where to go, or if you have any other questions, help is available. The Secretary of State's office in Olympia has opened a toll-free hotline for voter information: 1-800-562-5637.


In Seattle, the Democratic party headquarters can help at 583-0664. Or you can call the King County Democratic Central Committee at 622-9157. And the King County elections department has a caucus hotling staffed by political party volunteers at 344-7625.


The 1984 elections could be a major turning point in U.S. politics Issues of unemployment, budget deficits, civil rights and foreign policy are being sharply debated. It makes good sense to think about ways in which you might affect our future policies. The Democratic precinct caucuses are one close and available way.

Only three candidates are still hunting for the Democratic presidential nomination, and a nation-wide network of Asian Americans is trying to capture a lion's share of the votes for the Rev. Jesse Jackson.


Those who are part of Asian Americans for Jesse Jackson (AAJJ) are, like many other Democrats, willing to put anyone who is not Ronald Reagan into the president's office this November. But the AAJJ claims that Jackson's liberal platform and personal dynamism make him the best alternative to Reagan.


Jackson has promised during his campaign to: build a ""rainbow coalition"" of almost any group that has been ignored or oppressed, freeze the military budget and divert military funds to social programs and services, and cut off military aid to the Marcos regime in the Philippines and to rightist forces in Central America, sending instead food and medical supplies.


The Seattle branch of AAJJ was organized only three weeks ago and has about a dozen members. Bob Santos, an avid Jackson supporter and director of Inter*Im, believes Reagan's foreign policy will ignite a war in the Third World directed against the U.S. ""Jackson is the only candidate that has proven sensitivity and respect for Third World countries,"" said Santos. ""No one could have done what he did in Syria,"" he added, referring to Jackson's successful negotiation with the Syrian government for Lt. Robert Goodman's release.


Another reason Santos supports Jackson is that the Black candidate shares with Asian Americans the experience of living in a white-majority society. ""Knowing that, I feel he has a better handle on the tools to overcome discrimination,"" Santos said.


Tom Eng, another Seattle member, said he supports Jackson because he is forcing established political structures to address minority concerns. The Asian plank of the Jackson platform includes an end to racial violence, redress and reparations for Japanese Americans, opposition to the Simpson-Mazzoli immigration bill, and support for bilingual education.


""Jackson's making the Democratic Party more responsible to the people,"" said Eng.


Bill Chong, a New York tenant organizer and national vice chair of AAJJ, views Jackson's campaign as an opportunity for Asian Americans to break into mainstream politics. Asians must unite with other disadvantaged groups, said Chong. ""We can have the highest incomes, but not have any political power,"" he said. ""The Vincent Chin murder is an example.""


Asians can learn from the Black civil rights struggle, said Chong. ""We tend to be spectators in this type of movement and it's time we got involved,"" Chong asserted.


Uniting Blacks, Hispanics, Asians, Native Americans, poor whites, women religious groups, gays and other groups that compose Jackson's rainbow isn't easy, Chong admits. Misconceptions such as the myth of Asian success cause friction, as between Black and Korean store owners in New York.


""The rainbow coalition will not be an overnight success,"" said Chong. ""The fruit will be borne over several years.""


The campaign in the meantime enables ""the different communities to learn more about each other and their common experiences,"" according to Eng.


Jackson's candidacy has been hindered by late declaration, lack of funds, a well-publicized Jewish slur, and a pervasive feeling that the country isn't ready for a Black president. the perception that Jackson isn't ""electable"" has diverted potential Jackson votes to Walter Mondale and Gary Hart. So far Mondale has won almost eight times as many nominating delegates as Jackson.


But Jackson has won already, maintain his supporters, by turning the heads of the front-runners and spurring previously uninvolved citizens to action. Minority attendance in Washington's caucuses last Tuesday quadrupled; nationwide, millions of minorities have registered to vote.


Santos chides the Asians who ""talk about the need for justice and equality and hope the front-runners will listen. I think it takes a minority to really be sensitive, and we should support him [Jackson].""


The stronger Jackson's showing is, the more seriously the other candidates have to consider his platform. Jackson may hold the key to Democratic nomination. Neither Hart nor Mondale currently holds a decisive edge and if the convention deadlocks, Jackson can break the tie.

Elections may not always be the trademark of democracy. Sometimes they can be used as a ploy to prop up a regime that is discredited by the majority of its own people. Such is the case of the ""free and clean"" elections held in Chile, South Korea, El Salvador and in other U.S. supported dictatorships.


A similar scenario is unfolding in the Philippines. With an economy that is fastly deteriorating, a government that is fastly deteriorating, a government that is isolated both at home and abroad and a national democratic movement whose influence has been unprecedented in magnitude and scope, President Ferdinand Marcos is once again calling a Batasang Pambansa (National Assembly) election on May 14.


While some opposition politicians see this event as a good opportunity to gain control of the national legislature and eventually ease Marcos out of power, scores of organizations see the election as a political cosmetic totally devoid of meaning and significance.


Thus, the only logical response to such an illogical exercise is to boycott it.


Campaigning to boycott the election in a common front are members of the Nationalist Alliance for Justice, Freedom and Democracy, the Liberal Party faction of former President Diosdado Macapagal and Senator Jovito Salonga, The Alliance of Metropolitan Associations led by Butz Aquino, brother of the slain former Senator Benigno Aquino, the Movement for Philippine Sovereignty and Democracy led by former Senator Jose Diokno and the member organizations of the Justice for Aquine, Justice for All movement.


The rationale of the boycott movement is best expressed by former Senator Lorenzo Tanada when he said in an interview, ""If you participate in the election called by Mr. Marcos, you will be legitimizing it. This is what Marcos and Reagan wants -- legitimization of the government. Reagan wants it to appear that the government his administration is supporting is a valid democratic government. Election is not important these days. Election in normal days is important. But under a dictatorship, what is important is to remove the dictatorship, to recover our lost freedom, restore justice, peace and democracy in this country.""


This position is even supported by former Foreign Minister and Senator Raul Manglapus, a moderate who now lives in exrle in the U.S. In his speech before the World Affairs Council of Los Angeles last February 23, he said. ""No elections, no matter how attractive the compromise conditions, can truly reflect the popular will unless first the dictator is out of power. A dictator may allow some opposition in his rubber stamp parliament, but he will never allow himself and his dictatorship to fall by elections.""


Marcos has been accused of rigging eight elections and referendums in the Philippines since martial law was declared in 1972.


Towing a more radical orientation, the Nationalist Alliance for Justice, Freedom and Democracy accuses the United States government of pressing for a ""clean and honest"" election to:


-- halt the Marcos regime's heightening political isolation by refurbishing its tarnished image with the necessary trappings of democracy;


-- restore the people's confidence in parliamentary processes and thus avert their growing radicalization; and


-- stabilize the regime at a time of great political unrest to protect U.S. imperialism's vast economic, political, cultural and military interests in the country.


Others argue that the National Assembly, whose seats the pre-election candidates are vying for, is in itself a useless legislature because Marcos still possesses the authority to continue making laws under Amendment No. 6 of the Philippine Constitution, appoint higher government officials without confirmation, enter unilaterally in international treaties and agreements, veto Batasan (Legislative) measures as well as dissolve the Batasan itself.


With Marcos determined more than ever to hold onto his power, the election is unlikely to be honest and free. The U.S. knows that under a dictatorship no legitimate election is possible. In theory, the election might ""give democracy one last try."" In practice, the real power will still remain in the hands of Marcos' military.


Contends detained political activist Jose Ma. Sison, ""The real party of Marcos is not the Kilusang Bagong Lipunan, but the Armed Forced of the Philippines dominated as it is by a small clique of military officers who would do anything immoral and criminal to keep Marcos autocracy in power."" Sison further claims that behind deceptions such as referenda and elections is the use of the Armed Forces to violate the freedom of the people and to bloodily suppress any serious resistance to the autocracy. This apparatus of coercion is dependent on the U.S. for strategic planning and intelligence work, equipment and logistics and high level officer training.


How the Filipino people react to this ""ultimate reality"" will in the end determine the course of Philippine politics.

The media predicted that Jesse Jackson's low budget campaign, lacking organization and experience, wouldn't last very long. But after 35 primary caucuses and after watching five other Democratic presidential hopefuls drop out, Jesse Jackson's campaign continues.


As a volunteer on Jackson's campaign, I am often asked: ""Why support Jesse Jackson when he does not have a chance to win? Will supporting Jackson hurt the Democratic chances of defeating Ronald Reagan?""


This year is critical in that we must reverse the rightward trend of the Reagan administration and elect a president who will represent the needs and concerns of the majority of people. In over three years, Reagan has nearly dismantled all social service programs in favor of increasing military arms.


Objectively, Jackson's candidacy has been a positive influence on the Democratic presidential candidates, the party leadership and, most importantly, the outcome of the year's presidential election.


The tremendous support and enthusiasm for Jackson goes beyond the possibility of winning the Democratic nomination. His campaign has created a grassroots movement for equality, justice and political representation. He has been a key figure in transforming this year's electoral politics to reflect the aspirations and needs of the majority.


He has consistently called into question the increasing U.S. involvement in the internal affairs of Central American countries and the increasing military budget, called for enforcement of the Voting Rights Act and supported the Equal Rights Amendment. He has challenged his rivals and the party leadership to address these issues, rather than involve themselves in personal ""rat-a-tat-tat"" criticisms. His program of ""Justice at home and peace abroad"" has been the rallying point for his Rainbow Coalition. The Coalition, made up of the poor, people of color, the disenfranchised, women, and peace activists, has been a tremendous motivating force in gaining support for Jackson. It has been able to involve thousands in fundraising, educational forums, canvassing and grassroots organizing. Many people never before involved in a political campaign have donated their time, labor and resources to build a mass movement.


His quest for equality and justice, as a civil rights activist and now as a presidential candidate, has been the same struggle many Asians and Asian Americans have faced in America.


Although Jesse Jackson may not win the Democratic nomination, his candidacy has given a progressive edge to the anti-Reagan movement and has sharpened debate over foreign and domestic policies. He has helped move the general debate away from the right. By drawing in hundreds of thousands of people, Jackson's campaign promises to have a tremendous ""ripple effect"" throughout the U.S. The registration of millions of blacks and minorities could be significant enough to defeat Ronald Reagan. Additionally, the registration of millions could potentially open the doors for minority political representation.


Finally, support for Jesse Jackson does not preclude support for Walter Mondale or Gary Hart. In the final analysis, the defeat of Reagan is the central task. Jackson's candidacy has forced his opponents to take better stands on issues, thereby making his opponents more viable candidates to gather support in the upcoming November election.


Asian Americans for Jesse Jackson will hold a fundraising program on May 10 from 6 to 7:30 p.m. at the Bush-Asia Center. For more information, call Bob Santos at 624-1802, Tom Eng at 322-6476 or Stan Shikuma at 329-0172.

With the national Democratic convention scheduled for July, it is timely for Asians to reflect on the phenomenon sweeping U.S. politics in 1984: a Black Presidential candidate by the name of Jesse Jackson.


Jackson has registered on the electoral seismograph that he will be a power broker for those who have long been denied an equal share of power. He will test the mettle of equality with the Democratic Party. The battle will affect the November Presidential elections and beyond.


It is ironic that Jackson has pulled the rug out from under the party which has boasted of being the party of the working class, minorities and the have-nots. As Jackson's candidacy has shown, the Democratic Party has not really represented the vast numbers of working class and working poor, of which many are Asians and minorities.


As a matter of fact some party leaders view Jackson with trepidation. Some of the more sophisticated party officials have scurried to fulfill the long overdue demand for full enforcement of the 1964 Voting Rights Act, abolish the racist dual primary system (especially in the South), and restructure the discriminatory delegate selection rules (Jackson has garnered nearly 20 percent of the popular vote during the primaries, but only has nine per cent of the delegates).


Then there is the embarrassing reality that millions of Blacks, Hispanics, Asians and working poor who ""don't count"" are not even registered to vote. It has taken Jackson to tell the disenfranchised what they already know: that they have had, up to now, no real political representation, and therefore, no power.


The Jackson candidacy is a continuation of the fight for political enfranchisement which has some of its roots in the 1960s. If 1984 is the year to unite to oust Ronald Reagan, the Rainbow Coalition must assert that a change in one party's Presidential choice is really no change unless we have real representation of our interests. Perhaps 1988 will be the year of an independent political party with the Rainbow Coalition at its core.


""Our time has come!"" Jesse Jackson reminds us. This is the real significance of the Rainbow Coalition. It is more than simply a grassroots effort to inject some color into Presidential politics. It is the building of a multi-racial, cross-class political alliance with immense potential to influence every major social, political and economic question facing us, just as the Reagan administration, on the other side, has influenced the country in a devastating, reactionary way.


The movement represented by Jackson's candidacy has united around a common platform: justice and racial equality at home and true peace abroad. Jackson is the only candidate who makes the nexus between Reagan's militaristic foreign policies and racism and social austerity at home. Jackson is the only candidate who had made good on providing Asian Pacific American representation in his Rainbow Coalition, not simply for tokenism or political expediency. The essence of his platform says that Asians do count and, moreover, that we have much in common with the other Rainbow counterparts. Jackson has talked to us in the Chinatowns, barrios, ghettos, inner cities and reservations of this country, places where no other Presidential candidate has dared or cared to reach out.


Jackson has scored victories far beyond what was ever imagined at the outset of his short campaign. It has become clear that his political agenda is much larger than winning a spot as a Black vice-presidential candidate.


Jackson has raised the demands of those who have been silent like ghosts in the closets, upset the political balance, and most importantly, unleashed the aspirations of the bottom sectors of this society. It is up to Asians and others in the Rainbow Coalition to break out of their apathy, join him, hold him and others accountable to see that our interests are acted upon in the coming months and years.

The Seattle Police Department has developed a Business Watch Directory of all the merchants in the International District. The directory, created as part of the Police Department's Commercial Crime Prevention Program, has been delivered to all businesses in the area so that employees can locate a neighbor's name and phone number in the event of an emergency or suspicious activity.


Police Chief Patrick Fitzsimons, in a recent letter to District merchants, wrote, ""We found your most common concerns were 'street people' hanging around doorways and coming into shops bothering customers and merchants alike. Remember that Seattle has a criminal trespass ordinance, and if someone does not belong in your store that person can be asked to leave. If he or she refuses, you can call 911 and ask to have them removed.""

Neighborhood House continues to seek donations for an Emergency Loan Fund to help low-income people facing evictions or other crises. The fund was started following the March eviction in Yesler Terrace that ended in the deaths of Officer Michael Raburn and resident Robert Baldwin.


The goal is to begin operation of the fund by August with $7500--$1500 for each of the five Neighborhood House Centers in the public housing communities of Yesler Terrace, Holly Park, Rainier Vista, High Point and Park Lake. Nearly $700 has been raised since April.


The fund will assist low-income people whose checks have been detained in the mail, for instance, or those who have suffered sudden illnesses or unemployment. It is also designed so that those who benefit will be able to help others in similar situations by paying back the loan.


Tax-deductible contributions may be sent to Neighborhood House: 905 Spruce St., Seattle, WA 98104.

Elaine Ikoma-Ko, one of the driving forces behind the International District Housing Alliance since its formation in 1975, will begin a new job this month in the community services division of the City's Department of Human Resources.


Ikoma-Ko was one of the most tireless activists during the tumultuous era of the 1970s, during which the District obtained from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) two new low-income projects, the International House and the Imperial House, and obtained from the City a commitment to provide incentives and resources to building owners who would agree to renovate their aging structures.


The Housing Alliance was established by young Asian American activists who dedicated themselves to working with elderly longtime residents and advocating for affordable low-income housing in an area beset by deterioration and neglect and threatened by the newly constructed King County Domed Stadium nearby.


Before the Domed Stadium went up, City inspectors had closed down many of the District's apartment buildings which did not meet fire standards. Housing activists, concerned that the District might be reduced to parking lots and big businesses serving only Kingdome patrons, organized demonstrations and meetings to force commitments from government officials.


Ikoma-Ko, who probably holds some kind of local attendance record at tenant organizing meetings, said the Housing Alliance was launched in 1975 when she began work on housing issues as a staff member of the International District Improvement Association (Inter*Im) under director Bob Santos. The Housing Alliance got on its own two feet with independent funding in 1977.


The Housing Alliance and Inter*Im spearheaded the fight to keep open the historic Milwaukee Hotel, which was closed by court order in September, 1977 because of numerous fire code violations. To keep the hotel open, these two organizations marshaled the labor of over 100 volunteers who hauled away tons of debris, scraped walls, put up exit signs, repaired plumbing, installed wiring and organized a 24 hour fire watch for over 14 months. The Milwaukee was finally closed, however, at the end of September, 1979.


Through the years, the Housing Alliance has been sustained by funding from churches, social change foundations and City block grant funds, she said. A large majority of the Housing Alliance's board, she noted, are low-income elderly residents, which makes it difficult for the organization to hook up with corporate contacts who might provide the organization with greater financial resources.


""The Housing Alliance has always been a real grassroots organization, operated on a shoestring budget,"" she said. ""And we've always maintained the participation of residents who are affected by what happens down here. That's been the real strength of our organization.""


Ikoma-Ko, who will remain involved with the Housing Alliance, possibly as a board member, said the group ""still has a very vital advocacy role for the District,"" noting that tenants still face such problems as unfair rent increases.


And she noted a pressing need for more public housing: ""Many low-income people who've been on public assistance and refugees who've been cut off after 18 months of public assistance have called us or been referred to us. We then refer them to emergency housing or find any kind of place they can afford. It's hard because public housing -- they have waiting lists of people who want to get in. And family housing -- you could wait two years and more.""


Ikoma-Ko said public housing is ""a political hot potato because so many neighborhoods refuse to accommodate it."" And in the International District, she said, ""it would take a great deal of creativity and energy"" to convert buildings from single room occupancy units to public housing for families.


The Housing Alliance, Ikoma-Ko said, would also like to see more market rate and low-income housing created in the International District. She said there are still 954 vacant units which could be renovated for housing in the International District. But she said there was little immediate likelihood of more low-income housing because of dwindling federal support for subsidized housing under the Reagan administration.


She said efforts to develop housing in the District have been successful because of ""the blend of grassroots advocacy"" provided by unique individuals with great commitment: Bob Santos and Dan Rounds of Inter*Im; Al Kurimura and Doug Chin ""working on the inside"" at the City; Ben Woo, director of the Chinatown-International District Preservation and Development Authority; and Tomio Moriguchi, president of Uwajimaya. ""None of what has been achieved for the District would have come about without these strong individuals who made a difference with their efforts and the residents who have provided a sense of direction,"" she said.

The U.S. House of Representatives passed the controversial Simpson-Mazzoli immigration bill by a 216 to 211 vote last month, but groups opposing the measure say there is still a possibility the legislation will be defeated.


A joint conference committee made up of members appointed by both houses of Congress must now reconcile differences between the House bill, passed June 20, and the version passed by the Senate in May of 1983. Then a revised bill will be sent back to the House and Senate for another vote.


The immigration bill, named for its prime sponsors, Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., and Rep. Roman Mazzoli, D-Ky., seeks to discourage illegal immigration by penalizing employers who hire undocumented workers. At the same time, the bill offers amnesty to illegal immigrants who can prove they have been in the United States continuously for a minimum time period.


Described as a bill with ""something for everyone to hate,"" the Simpson-Mazzoli proposal has been discussed for three years as a political compromise to ease the problem of large numbers of people illegally entering and living in this country. Estimates of the current population of illegal immigrants in the U.S. varies from two million to as high as 12 million.


The Senate version of the bill, which has the support of the Reagan administration, has passed twice, both times by an overwhelming margin. The bill died in 1982 when the House did not act on the legislation that year.


Supporters of the Simpson-Mazzoli bill feel that the U.S. ""has lost control of its borders,"" and that current' immigration policies cannot restrict the numbers of people entering the country each year. While disagreeing with various parts of the proposal, supporters feel the Simpson-Mazzoli bill is the only immigration reform package that can be implemented any time soon.


Although few will argue against the need for immigration reform -- there hasn't been a comprehensive reform of U.S. immigration laws since 1952 -- opponents from a broad variety of interests have spoken out against different sections of the bill.


Conservatives object to providing amnesty to those already in the country illegally. Business groups don't want the added paperwork and legal responsibility they will have for checking each employee's documentation. While the House bill removed proposed criminal sanctions against employers and gives only citations or warnings for first offenses, the Senate bill calls for $1,000 fines for the first hiring of an illegal immigrant, and $2,000 for the second hiring. Frequent violators could face six-month jail sentences.


Labor groups have been divided on the bill, some arguing that the bill will open up thousands of jobs currently being filled by workers who have crossed the border illegally. The AFL-CIO supported the bill until the day before the House vote, but switched sides at the last minute when a House amendment created a new program that would allow immigrants to be imported temporarily for farm labor. The Senate bill streamlines the current temporary labor program, making it easier to bring immigrants in if domestic labor is unavailable. Farm owners, primarily in the Southwest, convinced the House that crops would rot before the paperwork could be processed to allow them to bring in foreign labor for work they say they cannot find American workers to do.


Minority and civil rights groups point out that the bill will lead to employer discrimination against ""foreign looking"" job applicants. Gerald Sheehan, legislative liaison for the American Civil Liberties Union of Washington, said the bill will create a mechanism by which ""employers can choose to discriminate against American citizens and resident aliens who are legally in this country.""


If an employer is inclined toward not wanting to hire a person because of the way the person looks or sounds, Sheehan said, the employer is ""not going to want to go through the burden"" of checking the job applicant's status with immigration officials.


Juan Bocanegra, chairperson of the local Committee to Defend Immigrant's Rights, a coalition formed to fight the Simpson-Mazzoli bill, agrees with Sheehan, but adds, ""People who are going to discriminate will do it anyway."" Bocanegra said the bill makes it difficult for minorities because employers who really care and want to help minorities ""will not want to take the risk"" of hiring a person and facing penalties if the employee turns out to be an illegal immigrant.


Bocanegra pointed out that the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) enforces the current immigration policies in a racially discriminatory manner, and that those practices will continue and expand in minority communities with the new legislation.


Illegal immigrants are perceived as mainly Hispanics, but according to the INS itself, a substantial portion of the nation's illegal immigrants are visa overstayers coming from countries all around the world.


According to Bocanegra only 55 percent of the undocumented workers in the U.S. are from Mexico, but 92 percent of those caught and deported are Hispanic. INS officials say aliens coming into the country on tourist, business and student visas are more difficult to catch because they are more sophisticated and can get better jobs than an illegal immigrant crossing the Mexican border. INS officials have estimated that about 500,000 visa overstayers became illegal immigrants last year.


Bocanegra said minority communities will face ""indiscriminate searches, and a whole wave of terrorism"" when the INS begins to search out employers violating the new immigration laws.


Another area of concern in the Simpson-Mazzoli bill is the change in refugee immigration. Tony Lee, an attorney who does legislative work for Catholic Charities, said that under current law, a person entering the country seeking asylum or refugee status has the right to judicial review of his or her case, and can take the case to the Supreme Court if they have the financial and legal resources to do so. Under the new immigration bill, a board set up by the INS will determine who gets asylum.


The proposed elimination or modification of the fifth preference visa category has been a major Asian and minority community concern. The fifth preference allows U.S. citizens to file immigrant visa petitions for their brothers and sisters overseas. In the Senate version of the bill, the fifth preference category would be eliminated, while a compromise in the House judiciary committee resulted in a change of the fifth preference definition to include only unmarried brothers and sisters.


According to a statement from the Washington State Commission on Asian American Affairs (CAAA), 72 percent of those currently on the visa backlog list for the fifth preference category are Asian. The CAAA statement adds that 80 percent of all immigration visa applicants from Asia are under the fifth preference. Outside of Asia only 25.3 percent of visa applicants are under fifth preference.


The CAAA statement said elimination or modification of the fifth preference would have a ""discriminatory impact against immigration from Asia,"" and would be ""inconsist with the basic principle of U.S. immigration policy of permitting family reunification."" The statement adds that the elimination of the fifth preference ""would base U.S. immigration policies on Western cultural concepts of the nuclear family by discriminating against the Third World cultural value of the extended family.""


Bocanegra points out that the new immigration bill is directed toward providing agricultural labor and so favors immigration by single men, not families.


Tony Lee calls the immigration bill ""an attack on the whole idea of the right to immigrate."" If the bill becomes law, Lee adds, it will be the ""implementation of a new philosophy that says, 'we are going to restrict immigration, especially from the Third World.'""


Lee explained that the Senate version of the bill would place a ceiling of 425,000 on the number of legal immigrants allowed into the country each year, not including refugees and immediate families of U.S. citizens. The joint conference committee will have to reach a compromise solution between that proposal and the House version which does not make any changes in the current law which has no world-wide ceiling, but sets a 20,000 cap on each individual country.


Laura Chin, executive director of the Organization of Chinese Americans (OCA), said in an interview from the organization's Washington, D.C. office that OCA has focused its efforts on raising the Hong Kong immigration quota from the present 600 all colonies are kept to. Chin said OCA is willing to accept the legislation passed this year by the House because it will raise the quota to 3,000, a ""good compromise,"" although less than the 5,000 quota OCA seeks. Raising the Hong Kong quota has been a fairly non-controversial area of the immigration bill because it is the ""only racist provision left"" in the immigration statutes, Chin said.


If the bill fails when Congress votes on the revised version, Chin said, her organization will work next year for total elimination of the quota, or will support Rep. Norm Mineta's bill, which calls for a quota of 5,000.


One likely compromise solution the House-Senate conference committee will reach will be setting 1981 as the cut-off date by which illegal immigrants must prove residency. The Senate bill would grant permanent residency to those who came to this country before 1977, and temporary status to those who came later, but before 1980. The House bill sets 1982 as the cut-off date, and grants immigrants only temporary residence for one year. Aliens can apply for permanent residence in their second year, but must meet certain requirements, including a ""minimal understanding of ordinary English and a knowledge and understanding of the history and government of the United States.""


Government officials think two million persons will apply for legal status if the Simpson-Mazzoli bill becomes law, but critics question how many individuals will be able to provide documentation to prove continuous residence, and it is unclear how the requirements will be enforced. Critics say it is unlikely illegal immigrants will come forward, facing possible deportation if they are not granted amnesty.


Supporters of the immigration bill had said they would like to see President Reagan sign the bill on Independence Day, but appointments to the joint conference committee were not made when Congress took a three-week summer break on June 30.


The Simpson-Mazzoli bill is expected to be a hot political issue at the Democratic Convention on July 16. All three Democratic presidential candidates have gone on record against the bill, and if an anti-Simpson-Mazzoli plank is written into the party platform it will be difficult for Democrats to support any bill that comes out of the conference committee. In the House, 125 Democrats voted for the bill and 138 voted against it.


""I think there's a chance to defeat it,"" said Juan Bocanegra, pointing out the closeness of the House vote. The anti-Simpson-Mazzoli effort will need support at the grassroots level, Bocanegra said, and he encouraged people to write to the Congressional Representatives and House Speaker Tip O'Neill.


Sheehan also sees a ""glimmer of hope"" that Congress will not accept the compromise version of the bill, and said that the last minute switch by the AFL-CIO did not give them a chance to do much lobbying. If labor lobbies strongly during the interim period, Sheehan said, there's a chance the bill still won't get through Congress.


""People shouldn't feel it's hopeless,"" Bocanegra adds.

Rev. Jesse Jackson, in his speech at the Democratic National Convention, called attention to the American quilt where today Asian Americans are ""shot on the streets."" That night, as throughout his campaign, Rev. Jackson embraced Asian and Pacific Americans concerns as his own.


A most significant and moving moment for our communities was when Rev. Jackson personally extended his sympathies to Mrs. Lily Chin, mother of Vincent Chin, at a June rally in San Francisco's Chinatown. Vincent Chin, a young Chinese American beaten to death by two white auto workers who blamed Japanese for ""stealing American jobs,"" strove in life to be the ""model minority"" and in death symbolized our historical lack of political power. Alone among the presidential candidates, Rev. Jackson spoke to the scapegoating of Asian Americans for the problems of the U.S. economy.


Rev. Jackson's campaign has also opened up the door to political empowerment for our community. In calling for the establishment of a ""Fairness Commission"" by those in the Democratic Party, he has set new ground rules for our participation in the political system. He has helped serve notice to the leadership of the Democratic Party that we will no longer be taken for granted.


The Rainbow Coalition invited Asian Pacific Americans to join as integral partners in a campaign to change the country's domestic and foreign policies. Rev. Jackson appointed a Vice Chair for Asian Americans in his national campaign and adopted a comprehensive Asian Pacific American platform. But he was candid in what he had to offer. In a May speech at the Los Angeles Japanese Cultural Center, he said, ""I cannot make promises about what I can do for you as Asian Americans. I can only ask you to join me as equal partners ... I can only promise you what we can achieve together, nothing more or less.""


A considerable number of Asian Pacific Americans actively involved ourselves in the Rainbow Coalition, organizing in the Bay Area, Los Angeles, Seattle, New York City, Boston and New Jersey. Even larger numbers voted in the primaries for Rev. Jackson who got 20 percent of the Asian Pacific American vote in California, 10 percent in New York and 25 percent in New Jersey.


Rev. Jackson was the first and only presidential candidate to tour New York City's Chinatown, visiting a senior citizens' center, a garment factory and a restaurant to learn about living and working conditions. In California, he visited both San Francisco's Chinatown and Los Angeles Japan Town. He also stayed at the home of a Filipino American family, where he restated his opposition to the U.S. government's support of the Marcos dictatorship in the Philippines.


In the Black communities of Harlem and Bedford-Stuyesant as well as the national media, Rev. Jackson spoke about the internment of almost 120,000 Japanese Americans during World War II and called for redress and reparations. He was also the most vocal opponent of the Simpson-Mazzoli Bill, one of the most racist immigration bills since the Chinese Exclusion Act.


Rev. Jackson's candidacy and the Rainbow Coalition have opened a new era of unity and co-operation between Black and Asian Pacific Americans. We need to continue such alliances with other disenfranchised peoples to defeat President Reagan and, more importantly, to run Asian Pacific Americans for office in our quest for political parity. Rev. Jackson has opened the door to political empowerment. It is up to us to step through. Our Time Has Come.

An unprecedented number of Asian and Pacific Americans took part in the Democratic National Convention last month in San Francisco, and for the first time a national Asian Pacific platform was developed as a plank in the national platform of the Democratic Party.


Five Asians were part of the Washington state delegation to the convention, and there are plans to form a Washington state Asian Pacific Caucus as part of the national Asian Pacific Caucus established last year within the Democratic National Committee.


There have never been more than a handful of Asian delegates to the Democratic National Convention, and the dramatic rise from three Asian delegates in 1980 to 103 Asian and Pacific delegates and alternates this year was noted by vice-presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro when she addressed a meeting of the Asian Pacific Caucus July 18.


Rev. Jesse Jackson and representatives of Sen. Gary Hart also addressed the caucus at various meetings throughout the week. Presidential candidate Walter Mondale issued a statement to the caucus addressing some of the positions taken in the Asian Pacific platform, including affirmative action, redress, and the Simpson-Mazzoli immigration bill.


Dissatisfaction was voiced, however, by some caucus members, including some of the Washington state delegates, over the decision-making process within the national caucus, and the types of caucus activities held.


According to East/West, a San Francisco Chinese community newspaper, Asian delegates from several states expressed dissatisfaction throughout the week with the lack of input by the majority of caucus members during drafting of the caucus platform which was presented to the Democratic National Committee, and the format of the daily caucus meetings. On Thursday, July 19, the last day of caucus meetings, the dissatisfaction broke into an open confrontation. The meeting was continued in a closed session, which most members seemed to feel brought positive results, East/West reported.


Several Washington Asian delegates described the Asian Pacific Caucus functions as ""disappointing"" and ""frustrating"" because of the lack of opportunity to meet the other Asian delegates and discuss issues. ""I went to San Francisco thinking I would make the Asian Caucus my number one priority,"" said Ya Yue Van, an at-large Mondale delegate who is on the Democratic Central Committee in Whitman County. Van had hoped to meet other Asian delegates from around the country and to ""band together to push for Asian issues, especially bilingual education,"" she said. But after attending Asian Pacific Caucus meetings for a few days, the closest she came to meeting another delegate was an alternate from Illinois who has been active in the national Asian Pacific Caucus. While she was impressed with many of the California Asian Pacific Caucus members she met at the caucus functions, Van said, ""I ended up not being able to do any business.""


Gary Locke, state representative from the 37th District in Seattle who attended the convention as an unpledged elected official delegate, said the Asian Pacific caucus functions were, ""A lot of speeches with little input or reaction by the delegates.""


Jan Kumasaka, an at-large Hart delegate who works for the Seattle Department of Community Development and the Booth Gardner gubernatorial campaign, said the Asian Pacific platform drafting and the caucus convention functions were really dominated by the California organizations. ""So we really felt out of it,"" she said.


But the delegates noted that, as a new organization and national political force, the Asian Pacific Caucus is still in its formative stages and should be commended for its work. ""It is a significant step that the caucus was formed and organized at all,"" said John Ishimaru, a graduate student in civil engineering at the University of Washington.


Locke said, ""I really was impressed with the amount of networking the California organizations that make up the California caucus were able to do. It would be great if we in the state of Washington can come even close to that.""


Groundwork for a Washington state Asian Pacific Caucus was begun at the state convention where there were 20 Asian delegates. Clarence Moriwaki, a Jackson facilitator at the state convention, was named convenor and will hold a meeting of the ad hoc state Democratic Asian Pacific Caucus in his home on Saturday, August 11.


Van said the Washington state caucus will be young, ""but I think we've got some good people"" who will be involved. Van hopes to be able to attend some of the caucus meetings but noted that she was the only Asian delegate from eastern Washington, and it will be difficult for her to attend meetings if they are all held in the Puget Sound region. Van is the assistant director of affirmative action at Washington State University, and is awaiting confirmation of her appointment to the state Commission on Asian American Affairs from the governor's office.


The delegates left the convention with a feeling of party unity and commitment to work for the Mondale-Ferraro ticket. They applauded the selection of the first woman vice-presidential candidate. ""I think the selection of Ferraro was a big plus for the ticket and has the potential for making the difference,"" said Ishimaru, a Hart delegate.


Kumasaka said it was really exciting to watch Ferraro at the Women's Caucus meetings, but added that she doesn't think there would be a woman on the ticket ""if it hadn't been for Jesse Jackson."" Kumasaka said Ferraro was introduced to the Asian Pacific Caucus by Reps. Bob Matsui and Norm Mineta, both congressmen from California, who seemed very enthusiastic about their colleague.


Arlene Oki, a program coordinator of the resource development unit for the City of Seattle, who attended the convention on the invitation of the national Asian Pacific Caucus, said she would like to see Asians ""as a bloc doing something for the ticket,"" but added that as of yet there isn't anyone locally who will be concentrating on the presidential campaign.


Stan Shikuma, a University of Washington student who lobbied for Jackson at the national convention, said that how Jackson and Hart supporters are included in the campaign structure will be key to the strength of the democratic ticket.


Shikuma said the Democrats will need a high voter turnout to defeat Reagan in the November election. The Mondale campaign will have a hard time if they ""start turning people off"" at this point in the campaign, he added.


The ad hoc Washington state Democratic Asian Pacific Caucus will meet August 11, from 1 to 3 p.m. at Clarence Moriwaki's home, 15130 65th Ave. So., Apt. 831, in Tukwila. His phone number is 433-8539 if you need directions.

Virginia Woolf once wrote: ""As a woman, my country is the whole world."" True to her words, the enthusiastic audience that packed Langston Hughes Cultural Center on August 27 for ""Word of Mouth"" was treated to an international peace talk between women from here to Japan to El Salvador and back.


The program, sponsored by Washington Physicians for Social Responsibility, featured a cast of Northwest area women reading a diverse collection of poetry and excerpts from speeches, essays and other writings by women over the past 80 years. The proceedings were hosted by Jill and Joann Klein, two of the Fabulous Sateens, who provided musical introductions to the readings.


The program was a good one. Some of the combinations seemed odd, but they worked. For example, a group of Asian actresses read Janice Mirikitani's ""We, the Dangerous,"" which reflects on how Americans were taught to view Asians as less than human during the Vietnam War years. Another actress, Marjorie Nelson, responded by reciting from Muriel Rukeyser's ""St. Roach,"" about a woman reaching out to strangers.


Other readings focused on what some might call a uniquely female vision of what the world should be like. An ensemble reading of Joan Cavanaugh's ""I Am a Dangerous Woman,"" and short excerpts of speeches by figures like Jane Addams, Pearl Buck and Woolf, explored the special role of women in opposing war -- whether it is because we are ""more moral"" than men, or simply more sensible. Some of the readings had a primarily historical significance, such as the reading of a letter from Salvadoran women in support of the peace camp set up by anti-nuclear feminists in the Pacific Northwest. Some of the speeches were mainly there to keep the crowd hyped, and they served their purpose, especially Tamu Gray's exhortation, as activist lawyer Florence Kennedy, to ""stop agonizing and start organizing,"" and Sara Jackson's shattering reading of Bernice Reagan's speech on ""Coalition Politics.""


The most effective moments, however, were the more personal readings about why women want peace. Jacqueline Moscou brought authentic intensity to her reading of Janet Thomas's ""Talk to a Daughter Not There,"" as an activist mother explaining the connection between the anti-war demonstrations in which the mother marched in the Sixties, carrying her baby, and the Southeast Asian refugee children who, in the Eighties, are now the child's classmates.


Lee Ann Fujii, in an excerpt from Jeanne Wakatsuki Houston's ""Farewell to Manzanar,"" recalled the angry pride of a Japanese American mother facing internment in 1942, who finally destroyed a set of good china rather than sell it for less than it was worth. Rose Cano, reading a speech given by United Farmworkers co-founder Delores Huerta, sounded like any working mother who, between getting arrested and walking picket lines, doesn't have enough time with the kids -- but she knows they understand. Susan Ludlow read from the diaries of Ettie Hillesum, a Jewish socialite who had the courage to hope in a Nazi concentration camp.


But the most electrifying reading of the night for me was Nikki Louis's rendition of a speech to the United Nations by Masahiro Sadanaga, a Hiroshima survivor. She talked about seeing children melt to death, crowds of people on fire throwing themselves into a river near the city for relief. This is what we are talking about, she said, and this is madness. No one there disputed it.


The evening closed with a brief statement from Nita Rhinehart, State Senator for the 46th District, who urged the crowd to put the sentiments of the reading into action.

""The unleashed power of the atom has changed everything save our modes of thinking and we thus drift toward unparalleled catastrophe.""


-- Albert Einstein, 1946


Marvin Lee and Elizabeth Yoshioka Lee, a couple from Portland, Oregon, have been calling up individuals in the Asian community in Seattle to share their ideas about ending the nuclear arms race.


Marvin and Elizabeth, who live with their three sons in Portland, are volunteering their time this summer, introducing community leaders in King and South King County to the concepts behind a project called ""Beyond War: A New Way of Thinking.""


""Beyond War"" is a project of Creative Initiative, a non-profit tax-exempt, educational foundation, formed in 1962 by 10 women who wanted to make difference in this world with their lives.


The project communicates four main points:


-- Nuclear weapons have made all war obsolete.


-- We live on one planet with one interdependent, interrelated life support system.


-- Today our survival requires that we live our lives based on this knowledge.


-- The action required is educating others to this new way of thinking in hopes of creating greater agreement regarding war in all its forms.


Washington State has been identified as one of 11 key states targeted for an educational effort by project organizers. The other states are. California, Colorado, Georgia, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Oregon, Vermont and Wisconsin.


The Reagan administration presents to the American public the concept of a ""survivable"" nuclear war--through the limited use of nuclear weapons. However, according to a statement issued by the project, the detonation of even a small percentage of the world's nuclear arsenals would trigger ""a nuclear winter."" Massive ash and dust clouds created by the nuclear detonations would shield our planet from receiving the warmth of the sun, chilling the planet and likely ending all human life.


The project stresses group agreement that war is obsolete as the ultimate arbiter of differences between nations.


Creative Initiatives utilizes a combination of personal contact and mass communication. The ""new mode of thinking"" is usually introduced in a two to three hour presentation/discussion format for groups ranging from five to 25 people.


The simple ideas behind the ""Beyond War"" project have been criticized as too simplistic. However, the optimism of Creative Initiative is based on research which shows that, when five percent of a society accepts a new idea, it is ""embedded"" in its population. And when the idea reaches 20 percent of the population, it is ""unstoppable.""


If you want more information about the project or would like a speaker for your group, contact Marvin and Elizabeth at: P.O. Box 19115, Portland, Oregon 97219.

""Once war is declared between America and another nuclear power, these bases will be the first targets of attack, and you who have studied nuclear wars know of their horrible consequences. Millions of Filipinos will be killed like ants, many more will die of cancer and leukemia and vast fertile lands in Luzon where these unwanted bases are located will become a veritable wasteland uninhabitable due to wide-spread contamination of the air we breathe, the food we take and the water we drink. Manila, which is less than sixty air miles from [the] bases, will not escape this national disaster unprecedented in the history of the country.""


These are the words of former Philippine Senator Lorenzo Tanada in 1981.


Not many Americans know that one legacy of America's continuous domination of the Philippines is the presence of two major U.S. bases reported to station nuclear weapons and carriers: Clark Air Base in San Fernando and the Subic Bay Naval Base in Olongapo City.


These bases, justified as deterrents against ""external aggressors,"" have been used, in the past, to support U.S. military activities in Japan, Korea and in the Indian Ocean.


Clark Air Base is reportedly home for the 3rd Tactical Fighter Wing, with its nuclear-capable F-4Es.


Subic Bay Naval Base plays host to the U.S.S. Sterett, a guided missile cruiser, and the nuclear-armed aircraft carrier Midway.


Sister Aida Velasquez, a Benedictine nun from Manila who participated in the American Friends Service Committee Peace and Justice Tour earlier this year, pointed out during her visit to Seattle that a group of Filipino civilian workers at the Subic Bay Naval Base were reportedly brought underground, blindfolded and later brought to a special place to take showers. One worker who did not follow instructions developed skin rashes.


The refusal of the Philippine and American governments to confirm the presence of nuclear weapons aroused the curiosity of former Senator Jose Diokno who, in his speech before the Nuclear-Free Philippines Coalition in 1982, asked why the nuclear-capable U.S.S. Sterett and the nuclear-capable F-4E fighter bombers would be stationed in the Philippines if there were no nuclear bombs and warheads stored there. Why, he asked, did the U.S. Naval Commander at Subic Bay issue instructions on March 10, 1978 on what to do in case of ""nuclear material accidents/significant incidents.""


Is it not reasonable to assume, Diokno pointed out, that if the U.S. goes to war, the Philippines would become a primary target of the United States enemies.


If Reagan's so-called ""limited nuclear war"" becomes a reality, the security of the Philippines would also be threatened. Because of the nuclear weapons stored in the Philippines, the country would be caught in a nuclear crossfire.


Dr. Helen Caldicott, the anti-nuclear leader in the United States, claims that the Westinghouse Nuclear Plant in the Philippines as well as the U.S. bases have been targeted by the Soviet Union in the event that the two superpowers engage in nuclear war.


Senator Diokno has said that one Poseidon submarine alone, armed with 16 ballistic missiles, each with 10 nuclear warheads, would kill or seriously injure some 18 million Filipinos.


With the memory of the nuclear holocaust that befell Hiroshima and Nagasaki still fresh in the minds of many, Filipinos have begun to take concrete steps to put an end to this nuclear madness.


Anti-nuclear activists and concerned students, teachers, clergy, workers and many professionals have formed the Nuclear-Free Philippines Coalition and started to rally citizens to work for elimination of nuclear weapons and oppression in the Philippines.


The Coalition views nuclear development as opposed to the development of an environment that permits a life of dignity and well-being. It condemns the Philippine nuclear plant in Bataan as unhealthy. It decries the continuing presence of U.S. military bases in the Philippines. And it sees the nuclear and military presence as a tool of imperialism which is used to control the country's resources and people.


The struggle of Filipinos for a nuclear free Philippines is, in the end, a struggle for true independence. A nation is not free when the threat of nuclear havoc hovers above its citizens with increasing intensity.


Economic and political development is important for a civilized nation. But when a nation can be totally annihilated at the push of a button, one begins to wonder whether being independent is compatible with being subservient to 'America's nuclear interests and ambitions.

Most Americans believe the nuclear arsenal of the United States serves to deter a Soviet nuclear attack on our country by threatening retaliation in kind. As a policy directive, this is certainly a major rationale, but it is only half the story. What most Americans do not realize -- and have not been told -- is that nuclear weapons have a second important function: to back up the use of conventional armed forces overseas and to deter any similar use of conventional armed forces by other powers. This link between nuclear arms, conventional forces and foreign intervention is crucial to understanding current U.S. foreign and military policies.


Historically, the U.S. has viewed nuclear weapons as a logical, if somewhat extreme, extension of conventional warfare and foreign policy. The stated purpose for the use of nuclear weapons over Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 was to end a conventional war. General Douglas MacArthur called for the use of nuclear weapons against both North Korea and China during the Korean War. President Eisenhower considered using nuclear weapons to aid the French when they were being defeated by the Vietnamese at Dien Bien Phu, and his Secretary of War, John Foster Dulles, wrote a memo complaining of the difficulty of using atomic bombs due to adverse public opinion.


In the 1960s, President John Kennedy viewed nuclear weapons as one option against Cuba during the Cuban missile crisis. Later, both Presidents Johnson and Nixon entertained the notion of using nuclear weapons to ""win"" the Vietnam War. Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger went so far as to threaten the Vietnamese with nuclear warfare if they did not come to the negotiating table. And during the hostage crisis under the administration of President Jimmy Carter, calls to ""nuke Iran"" were all too common.


All these nuclear threats were aimed at Third World, nonnuclear states. They all involved countries where the U.S. has historically intervened politically and economically, as well as militarily. All these past administrations considered the nuclear threat a logical and reasonable foreign policy tool. Up to the present, only a healthy fear of strong, adverse public opinion has prevented the use of nuclear weapons.


We now face a very dark period. Since 1980, the U.S. has started deploying two new first-strike weapons systems, the MX and the Pershing II missiles. We are proceeding to make Star Wars a reality in a new twist on the arms race in space. We have halted all disarmament talks with the Soviets, and increased the military budget by an incredible 50 percent in four short years. In 1985, the military budget will eat up $270 billion of our tax dollars, 20 percent to nuclear forces and 80 percent to conventional forces. And that figure will increase even further, regardless of the outcome in the November elections.


Foreign interventions and international tensions have increased under the Reagan administration. From the Caribbean to the Middle East, from Central America to the South Pacific and on into the Persian Gulf, the U.S. has sent in troops, conducted military exercises or training programs, and generally intervened in the affairs of other nations. This policy of domination and intimidation is made possible by our large nuclear arsenal. Of the 30,000 nuclear weapons in our possession, roughly 20,000 are tactical weapons: weapons designed for use in a conventional war setting. The other 10,000 are strategic weapons: intercontinental weapons. These are the weapons our leaders are referring to when they talk of ""limited"" nuclear war or ""protracted"" nuclear war. And we are currently being led down a path towards war.


Most Americans think nuclear war in unthinkable, that no one could possibly be so crazy as to actually push the button that would end all life on Earth. Unfortunately, few leaders, either in the U.S. or the Soviet Union, seem to share this world view. Strategies for gaining global pre-eminence and protecting spheres of influence dominate their thinking. Tactical nuclear weapons are viewed simply as gradations of military response in a continuing superpower rivalry.


In a recent poll by Newsweek, nearly 60 percent of top U.S. military commanders surveyed felt that nuclear war could arise out of a regional conflict. Nearly 70 percent felt a conflict in the Middle East could draw in both superpowers. Freezing the nuclear arms race is a necessary and urgent first step towards peace, but clearly is not enough by itself. Foreign military interventions, by any power, must also be stopped if we are to eliminate the most dangerous pretexts for nuclear war.


Asian/Pacific Americans should be in a position to understand the dangers and the social impact of U.S. military interventions, both nuclear and conventional. We should know about atomic bomb survivors and radiation poisoning. We should know about the loss of independence and disruption of local economies that accompany the building of foreign military installations. We should know about the costs, in terms of anti-Asian violence and cutbacks in social programs, that overfunding of the military entails. Most of all, we should be active in changing an irrational system that threatens our very survival.

President Ronald Reagan's portrayal of Nicaragua as an authoritarian state in civil war is not true, an American journalist working for the Agencia Nueva Nicaragua (Nicaraguan News Agency) said last Saturday in Seattle.


William I. Robinson, touring various American cities, arrived in Seattle last weekend ""to break the blockade of information about the New Nicaragua.""


Robinson, who spoke at Seattle University and the Central Area Motivation Program, described the progressive transformation of the Nicaraguan economy, the literacy crusade, the adult education program, the Cuban technicians and doctors, the continuing politicization of the people and the U.S. destabilization plans.


""There's no civil war in Nicaragua, but there is military aggression,"" he said. ""The people are getting ready to resist massive U.S. intervention.""


Robinson talked at length about the November 4 Nicaraguan national elections in which voters will decide the country's president, vice president and a 90 member national assembly.


The coming election is the first free and honest election Nicaraguans have had Robinson said. But he added that the U.S. government is fearful that the election will legitimize the revolutionary process and has stepped up its efforts to discredit the Nicaraguan government.


To carry out its political objectives, the Reagan administration has charged that the Sandinista government was forced to call the election because of pressure from the U.S. government, Robinson said.


""It simply is not true,"" he said. Robinson noted that the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) called for elections in a 1979 transitional plan decree. ""Calling for elections goes back a long time and is not a product of the Reagan administration,"" he added.


Robinson stressed that the electoral law provides all participating parties equal access to the media. The state guarantees 30 minutes daily on each of the two public TV channels and 45 minutes on each of the 16 public radio stations for the campaign, to be equally divided among the participating parties. The state, he said, also provides nine million cordobas or $900,000 to every party.


""Numerous provisions limiting freedom of the press, travel, assembly and speech that had been put in place as part of Nicaragua's defense against the U.S.-backed Contras were suspended for the duration of the campaign period,"" Robinson wrote in a recent issue of Frontline. ""Further, when key opposition forces refused to register by the July 25 deadline, a two week extension was allowed; and when the rightists did not register even then, they were given permission to apply under special consideration.""


Robinson said that 1.5 million citizens registered to vote out of the 1.6 million in the voting population. ""There's absolutely no room for fraud,"" he said.


Robinson said there are seven political parties participating in the election, ranging from extreme left to extreme right and ""they are not window dressing oppositions.""


Robinson, however, admitted that there are three political parties, whose combined membership is less than 1,300, that are not participating.


These parties,he said, presented nine demands to the FSLN as conditions for participating in the elections. Four of the demands were: return of all confiscated properties, dissolution of various mass organizations, placing the elections under international control, and permitting the return of the Contras and release of those in jail.


These demands all point to reversing the power of the people and thus were rejected, Robinson said.


Robinson condemned the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency for financing, arming and training the Contras, who are out to sabotage the election as well as the government. He noted that Ray Hooker, a FSLN national assembly candidate, was kidnapped by the Contras in July.


""The Nicaraguan people, however, are determined to keep decisions over their destiny in their own hands,"" Robinson wrote in a recent article. ""If the electoral process has accelerated Washington's preparations for counter-revolution, it has raised the political consciousness and militancy of Nicaraguan workers and peasants all the more. . . .


""As a result, the outcome of the elections will be the strengthening of the Nicaraguan revolutionary process and the deepening of its class character. It is on that basis that post-election Nicaragua will gird for the heightened assault U.S. imperialism has already promised is on the way.""

The problem of the homeless is staggering. In the Seattle-King County area, approximately 3,000 are homeless. As available emergency shelter beds are taken every night, increasing numbers of needy persons are turned away, forced to sleep under bridges, in parks and in alleys.


At the very root of the problem is the enormous loss of permanent, low-income housing, especially single room occupancy units. Between 1960 and 1984, Seattle lost 16,270 units of low-income housing, a 70.4 percent decline. Ten low-income buildings -- including the Central, Blackstone, Astor and Calhoun -- have recently been or are being systematically abandoned or converted.


Just as alarming, within the last month, the City has received five applications to demolish low-income residential buildings in downtown -- a record number -- which would result in the loss of 306 units of low-income housing. In addition, there are requests to renovate and upgrade two existing low-income buildings, which would result in the loss of 111 low-income units.


Thus, the City faces the potential loss of 417 units of low-income housing in one month.


Abandonment and demolition of low-income residential buildings are expected to intensify with the construction of the Convention Center over the free-way and the general construction boom of downtown office development. Many owners of residential buildings, expecting property values to go up, are holding their buildings for speculation and have stopped maintaining them, leading to abandonment and eventual demolition.


If these buildings are saved from speculative abandonment and are once again used to house some of Seattle's residents, many of the homeless women, children, elderly, disabled and economically deprived persons can be sheltered.


Permanent housing for many of the homeless would help them stabilize their lives. For instance, a person otherwise eligible for public assistance would meet the final requirement: a permanent address. Mentally ill and chronic alcoholics would be able to normalize their lives and seek appropriate treatment. Children would be able to lead ""normal"" lives. Homeless persons would be able to leave the cycle of suffering, illness and despair that began when their homes were lost.


Faced with the potential loss of hundreds of units of low-income housing and the social problems this causes, community, organizations, housing groups, social service agencies and churches have asked the Mayor and City Council to declare a state of emergency. These groups are requesting the enactment of an emergency ordinance imposing a moritorium on abandonment of housing units and passage of the new Housing Preservation Ordinance on an interim basis.


These emergency measures would preserve existing housing units before they are irretrievably lost. These emergency measures would remain in effect while the Mayor and City Council consider more permanent measures to deal with this housing crisis over the next few months.


The crucial need for preserving and maintaining decent affordable housing is compounded because the Reagan administration has basically eliminated funds for construction of new subsidized housing. Given the huge federal deficits and the conservative political climate, the prospect for housing looks bleak.


The coalition of groups supporting the retention of affordable low-income housing is asking for public support. The coalition asks citizens to write to the City Council and Mayor, requesting enactment of the emergency measures being proposed. The Council will consider this issue during the first week of November, so time is important. If you have questions, call Sue Taoka at 624-1802 or Tony Lee at 382-4844.

The 1984 elections are now history and Ronald Reagan has been returned to the White House in a landslide victory over Democratic challenger Walter Mondale. While many expected Reagan to win handily, few suspected the margin would be so large. Reagan won 59 percent to 41 percent in the popular vote, 525 to 13 in electoral college votes.


In the aftermath of the campaign, political analysts have been busy speculating on the meaning of the results -- for Republicans, Democrats and the American people. Does the Reagan landslide signal a public mandate for the New Right agenda? Could Mondale and the Democrats have done any better, or was the outcome inevitable? And what are some of the implications for the American people over the next four years?


NO MANDATE FOR THE RIGHT


Although the elections constituted a major personal triumph for Ronald Reagan, they cannot convincingly be argued as a mandate for the New Right agenda. First, the New Right, as represented by the Republican Party, experienced some mixed results outside of Reagan's re-election. Republicans gained 14 seats in the House of Representatives and lost two seats in the Senate. In Washington State, Republican incumbent John Spellman was ousted by Democratic newcomer Booth Gardner. Republicans did score moderate gains in state legislatures, particularly in the South, but the Democrats still retain control of two-thirds of all state legislative bodies. The New Right clearly made some gains, but not at all in proportion to what the Reagan landslide promised.


Reagan benefitted from a low voter turnout. The 1980 elections had the lowest voter turnout in over 20 years; the 1984 elections were a close second. Less than 33 percent of all eligible voters voted for Reagan in 1984, up from 26 percent in 1980. Over 45 percent either didn't register or didn't vote for various reasons. Statistics show that 80 percent of those earning over $30,000 per year are registered, while 35 percent of those earning less than $10,000 per year are registered. They also show that 90 percent of the poor register as Democrats and that the poor and minorities are the most likely not to vote. Any substantial increase in voter participation, then, would arguably have cut into Reagan's victory margin.


Finally, numerous pre-election polls showed that many Reagan supporters liked the man -- his strength, leadership, charisma -- but disagreed with his policies on such issues as nuclear arms, Central America, the budget deficit and cuts in social services. Reagan capitalized on his acting ability to sell himself to the public no matter what he did on the job, hence his reputation as the ""Teflon"" president.


For various reasons, the Reagan landslide need not be viewed as a mandate for the New Right. It does, however, indicate something significant about the public mood. Reagan's themes of ""Peace Through Strength,"" ""America is Back,"" and ""the Evil Empire"" play on people's fears for the future, their yearnings for simpler or better times and a deep-seated anti-Communism. Reagan forged a winning plurality of votes by using simple, direct action -- such as military -- rather than complex, lengthy diplomatic processes, coupling that approach with an unabashed appeal to nationalism.


MONDALE AND THE DEMOCRATS


The Democrats entered the primary season with eight viable candidates, three of whom made it to the National Convention. Some feel the hard fought primary battles depleted Mondale and the party, while others feel the energy and excitement of the race was a valuable asset squandered in the post-convention period. Certainly the long nomination battle exacted a heavy toll on the Democrats' war chest. Republicans amassed over $300 million in campaign funds compared to $60 million for the Democrats.


Other factors seem equally significant however. One was Mondale's failure to mend fences and pull the Democrats together after winning the nomination in San Francisco. Supporters of Gary Hart were only partially appeased at the convention, and Jesse Jackson supporters in the Rainbow Coalition were virtually left out in the cold. Mondale did try to appease conservative Southern Democrats, but many defected to the Reagan camp anyway. Meanwhile, a good share of Hart supporters defected as well, while many Jackson supporters decided to either sit out the election or concentrate on local races instead.


The Democratic Party also failed to adopt a platform that would present a clear alternative to Reaganism. Instead, it adopted the most conservative platform in years, one seemingly more concerned with who it might offend than with who it should win over. Blacks and other minorities were taken for granted, and their concerns shunted aside. The Democrats made a bold move in selecting Geraldine Ferraro, the first woman vice presidential nominee, yet failed to follow it up by focusing strongly on such major women's issues as comparable worth, childcare or the plight of single working mothers. In a vain attempt to compete for conservative white voters, the Democrats, succeeded only in eroding their support in other sectors.


ELECTION IMPLICATIONS


As Reagan put it, ""You ain't seen nothing yet."" Under his first administration, military expenditures, corporate profits and the budget deficit soared. The poverty level increased, and the average per capita income decreased. Funding for education, health care, child nutrition, public housing, public television and the arts decreased. Incidents of racial violence increased as well. All of these trends can be expected to continue during Reagan's second term.


On the international front, no new initiatives, diplomatic or otherwise, have been pursued in the Middle East. ""Constructive engagement"" with the outlaw apartheid regime in South Africa continues unabated. U.S. involvement in Central America has been stepped up in the last two weeks, and administration officials are discussing the possibility of direct military intervention in the region. Nuclear arms talks are reportedly being investigated, but none are yet scheduled. These trends will likely continue as well.


Meanwhile, the Democrats are holding a summit in the Virgin Islands to plot a new course for the 1986 and 1988 elections. Most seem convinced that Mondale's defeat signalled the death of the traditional ""New Deal"" coalition. They will continue to seek support from those most threatened by Reaganism -- minorities, the poor, women, labor, non-Christians -- but want to reach out to broader sectors of the white middle class. If they appeal to the highest ideals and aspirations of society, a revitalized party will emerge. If they choose instead to follow Reagan's lead in appealing to each individual's lowest self-interests, a divided party will continue.


Grassroots activists will continue to fight for progressive, people-oriented politics at the local level, regardless of either party's direction. A prime example of this trend is the Rainbow Institute here in Seattle. The Institute, initiated by some volunteers in the Jesse Jackson campaign, has busied itself in recruiting and training everyday people to get involved in the political process as Precinct Committee-persons. The emphasis on grassroots involvement and official accountability struck a chord among those seeking a better life for those in the community.


The 1984 elections brought victory to the Republicans, but not a clear mandate for New Right policies. They brought defeat, as well as some hard lessons, to the Democrats. And for the American people, they brought ""four more years"" of profits for the rich, and struggle for the poor, the homeless and the disenfranchised.

Local citizen committees have legislated 86 nuclear weapon free zones in New Zealand, Helen Clark, member of the New Zealand Parliment, said during a brief stop in Seattle earlier this month.


Clark shared lessons from New Zealand's grassroots peace movement, which made possible the present nuclear-free policy, at a forum here December 5, organized by the Northwest Network for a Nuclear Free and Independent Pacific and the King County Nuclear Weapons Freeze Campaign.


Clark explained that 61 percent of New Zealand's population lives in the nuclear weapon free zones, which translates into overwhelming public support for a national nuclear-free policy.


Basically, New Zealand's policy prohibits nuclear weapons on its soil, in its harbors and air space.


Other countries that have banned nuclear weapons from their territory include Denmark, Norway, Holland, Romania and Greece.


At present, New Zealand is negotiating with 13 other South Pacific nations to create a treaty to prohibit the manufacture, use, storage and acquisition of nuclear weapons in the South Pacific.


""New Zealand hopes to contribute to world peace by trying to take the lead in nuclear free issues,"" Clark declared.


Clark, noting the strength of the peace movement in her country, pointed out that 50,000 people turned out for last year's Hiroshima Day. New Zealand only has a total population of three million.


""Increasingly,"" Clark said, ""we're now looking at ourselves as a Pacific people, not a detached part of the . . . of Europe, and this is quite a significant change in New Zealand thinking which has ramifications right through our foreign policy, defense policy and internal policies.""


Clark attributed this reorientation in part to a growing sensitivity to the concerns raised by New Zealand's indigenous population, the Maoris. The Maoris, she said, have made links with other indigenous South Pacific peoples in the fight against colonialism.


In part, the struggle has centered on the devastating human and environmental effects of nuclear weapons testing on the Micronesians in the American Trust Territories, the Aboriginals in South Australia and the Polynesians in French Polynesia.


The Maoris and other indigenous South Pacific peoples are struggling against foreign domination, attempting to assert their right to survive as a people and determine their own destiny.


New Zealanders have been sympathetic in opposing nuclear dangers as demonstrated by their protests since 1966 of French nuclear testing in Polynesia. However, it is only more recently that a similar concern has been extended to the issue of self-determination raised by the Maoris.


Secretary of State George Shultz has reacted hostilely to New Zealand's nuclear free program, which would have the immediate impact of forcing U.S. Navy nuclear warships to discontinue their occasional rest and recreation visits.


More threatening to the U.S. is the possible precedent of not admitting nuclear ships into the Pacific regions. New Zealand's policy could also change the 33-year-old ANZUS pact between Australia, the United States and New Zealand.


According to Clark, New Zealand is willing to participate in the ANZUS alliance on strictly non-nuclear terms. Clark described ANZUS as ""a conventional defense alliance which commits its signatories only to consult in the event of a threat to territorial integrity.""


""Neither its letter nor its spirit obliges New Zealand to embrace the alleged protection of the American nuclear umbrella,"" much less nuclear warship visits, Clark said.


The Reagan administration is more concerned about the possible precedent set by New Zealand refusing to allow U.S. nuclear warships to dock. In particular, if Japan, Australia, or the Philippines were to adopt such a position, American military maneuvering power would be severely curtailed.


Clark emphasized that New Zealand prefers a relationship with the U.S. based on mutual self-respect and dignity, rather than one dictated by U.S. interests.


The strength of the New Zealand peace movement is clearly linked to local organizing and to a growing sensitivity to the concerns of the Maoris. The peace movement in the U.S. has much to learn in this regard.


The New Zealand experience suggests that peace activists examine the relationship between the issues of peace and justice. A broadening of the nuclear free movement in the U.S. requires an alliance with minority peoples' movements.

The Chinese Forum, a non-partisan group of Chinese American community business and academic leaders in California, last week urged President Reagan to appoint a Chinese American to fill the current vacancy on the National Science Board.


U.S. Senators Pete Wilson and Alan Cranston of California, as well as leaders of the Chinese American community nationwide, have given their support to this effort.


In the entire history of the National Science Board, no Asian American has ever been appointed to the Board. The Board oversees the National Science Foundation, which has an annual budget of over $1 billion for basic and developmental research in all aspects of science.


Senator Pete Wilson said, ""Considering the great contributions Chinese Americans have made to science and technology over the past four decades, the National Science Board would be well served with the addition of a member from the Chinese American community.""


Senator Cranston said, ""The Americans of Chinese ancestry have contributed much to American science and technology. Representation on the National Science Board would be fitting recognition of their contribution to the advance of the human frontier.""


The members of the Chinese Forum have recommended the following individuals for the current vacancy: Dr. Chang Ling Tien, Vice Chancellor and Professor of Mechanical Engineering at the University of California at Berkeley; Dr. Ernest Kuh, Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of California at Berkeley; Dr. Chia-Wei Woo, President and Professor of Physics at San Francisco State University; and Dr. Chen Ning Yang, Professor of Physics at the State University of New York.

National attention has focused recently on South Africa and its system of racial segregation known as apartheid. Although apartheid has existed officially since 1948, and unofficially much earlier, many Americans are still ignorant of the vicious nature of the social and political system that the United Nations has branded ""a crime against humanity.""


The Republic of South Africa, more properly called Azania by the indigenous people, occupies the southern tip of the African continent. It encompasses a territory larger than the combined area of Washington, Oregon, California and Nevada. It also maintains illegal control over Namibia (South-West Africa), a former UN trust territory with an area roughly twice the size of California.


Azania is a resource rich nation, with vast tracts of fertile farmland and a wealth of diamonds, gold, uranium and other strategic minerals. It sits astride the Cape of Good Hope and the major shipping lanes connecting the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Furthermore, due to the economic development under colonial rule, Azania stands at the hub of rail and trade routes for the whole southern African region of Namibia, Angola, Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique.


The population totals about 31 million: 23 million blacks, 5 million whites, 2.5 million ""coloreds"" (mixed-race) and 800,000 Asians. Apartheid refers to the system set up to ensure that all political and economic power remains firmly, solely, and perpetually in the hands of the white minority.


The white population call themselves Afrikaners. They are descendents of Dutch, German and British settlers who colonized Azania starting from the late 17th century. Since the creation of the Union of South Africa in 1910, they have steadily and methodically put together a system of government and a way of life totally dependent on cheap non-white labor.


In the early 1900s, laws were passed that effectively drove blacks off the land and into the mines, factories and fields of the growing white South African economy. In 1948, these earlier laws were enlarged and codified into a constitutional system of mandated inequality between whites and non-whites known as apartheid.


Under apartheid, blacks cannot own land or travel freely. At all times, they must carry passbooks with them that stipulate where they work, where they live and where they are allowed to be. Any white can demand their passbook at any time, and if they refuse to produce it, do not have it, or are in an unauthorized area, they may be jailed. Over 1,000 people are arrested under the Pass Laws each and every day.


Another aspect of apartheid is the government policy of establishing black ""homelands"" called Bantustans. Thirteen percent of the most barren land in Azania is reserved for over 70 percent of the population. There are no cities or industry in the Bantustans; blacks must travel to white areas of the country to find work. Black families are often not allowed to follow their men as they seek work, so the Bantustans are largely populated by women, children and elderly.


Outside the ""homelands,"" blacks are forced to live in townships which are little more than sprawling urban ghettoes. The townships are kept well away from white residential, industrial and downtown shopping areas, so blacks must commute in and out from work every day. ""Coloreds"" and Asians also have their own designated areas in which to live. No mixing of races is allowed.


Under apartheid, education and health care for blacks are virtually ignored. Half of all black children in Azania die before the age of five due to a simple lack of food, sanitation and medical services. Black children must pay to attend school in crowded, often rundown classrooms, while white children attend free, universal and modern schools. Whites in South Africa have one of the highest standards of living in the world, maintained at the expense of the misery and exploitation of the vast majority of the population.


Blacks have a long history of struggle against this oppression, and many black organizations have developed over the years. Many Asians, ""coloreds"" and whites have also joined in opposition to the established order. Unfortunately, government suppression has been severe, with many leaders killed, imprisoned or ""banned, ""a particularly vicious form of house arrest."" Many have been forced underground or into exile.


Two of the oldest black liberation groups are the African National Congress (ANC), founded in 1912, and the Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC), founded in 1959. These two organizations are among the leaders in the armed struggle developing there now.


Recently, apartheid in South Africa has reemerged into the international limelight. The white minority government, under continued international pressure to repudiate the policies of apartheid, enacted a new constitution giving nominal parliamentary representation to Asians and ""coloreds,"" but not to blacks.


Hundreds of thousands of blacks demonstrated in protest against the new constitution and around other political demands. More than 150 protesters were killed by South African soldiers sent into the townships to quell the protests, and dozens of black leaders were detained without charge.


Asians and ""coloreds"" called for a boycott of elections for what they labeled sham reforms. The boycott was 80 to 90 percent successful. At the same time, Bishop Desmond Tutu, an outspoken critic of the apartheid regime, was named the recipient of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize.


In response to these dramatic developments, major black leaders in the U.S. launched the Free South Africa Movement with a sit-in at the South African embassy in Washington, DC. Over the past month, nearly 200 people have been arrested nationwide in protests opposing both apartheid in South Africa and Reagan administration support for it through the policy of ""constructive engagement.""


Under President Reagan, the United States has refrained from criticizing the apartheid regime in South Africa. Instead, Reagan claims to be using ""quiet diplomacy"" to gently entice South Africa away from its repressive policies. Concretely, this has meant a tremendous surge in economic dealings with South Africa, a pariah among nations, on whom the United Nations has slapped an economic boycott.


William Garling, legal counsel for the Rainbow Institute and member of the Democratic Party's National Platform Committee, states that ""Western influence bringing progress is an untruth. It's totally wrong. Apartheid allows [U.S. corporations] to make superprofits, and that's why they're in South Africa to begin with."" They are not there, he stresses, to help the black majority reform the system.


""It's not simply a question of blacks getting a 'fair share' of the present system. Some blacks might get a better deal, but capitalism being what it is, the vast majority would not benefit. The white minority will not willingly allow the redistribution of wealth necessary to make [reforms] work.""


""Constructive engagement,"" he believes, like ""new constitutions"" in Azania, is no more than an illusion designed to allow the continuance of business as usual. And with $15 billion invested, American multi-nationals are involved in some pretty big business.

Over 600 people poured into a posh residential neighborhood on December 9 to protest the presence of a South African Consulate here in Seattle. Police arrested 24 protesters outside the consul's residence as they marched onto the property in a well-organized display of civil disobedience.


One day earlier, delegates at the King County Democratic Reorganization Convention unanimously passed a resolution calling for removal of all diplomatic, economic, educational and cultural ties between Seattle, King County and the racist apartheid regime of South Africa.


These local actions are part of a wave of protests aimed at pressuring the South African government to end its practice of apartheid, legally mandated separation of the races. Since the presidential elections, nearly 200 persons have been arrested outside of the South African Embassy and consulates nationwide.


These U.S. actions have been organized in support of protests conducted by hundreds of thousands of black South African students and workers in the past four months. Protest organizers also want to send a clear message to the Reagan administration that its policy of ""constructive engagement"" with South Africa must end.


Those arrested locally included: Bob Santos, executive director of the International District Improvement Association; Jesse Wineberry, Representative-elect from the 43rd District; and Rev. Samuel B. McKinney, pastor of Mt. Zion Baptist Church and co-chair of the Washington State Rainbow Coalition. They along with the 21 others arrested, were volunteers who had previously indicated their intention to peacefully demonstrate their moral outrage at the South African system of apartheid and U.S. support of it.


Vivian Sessoms is a leader in the Seattle Coalition on South Africa, one of the main groups sponsoring weekly pickets at the consulate over the last four months. The protests started, she said, ""in response to a call put out by the African National Congress,"" one of the main black liberation groups in South Africa. (The Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania is another.)


She is delighted with ""the explosion of interest following the arrests in Washington, DC,"" but hopes that the momentum will continue and not fade away with the coming of the holiday season. Prior to the national attention of the past few weeks, she reports, it was almost impossible to get a serious response on the issue from the many elected officials and community leaders her group contacted.


William A. Garling, author of the resolution passed by the King County Democratic Organization and legal counsel to the Rainbow Institute, Inc., firmly believes that ""people in the state of Washington, contrary to corporate interests, do not wish to see their funds added to support of apartheid."" A strongly worded resolution, he feels, will let elected officials know that ""we will not be party to a system that promotes continued exploitation of black people in South Africa.""


His resolution calls on the King County Executive and the Mayor of Seattle to work toward: termination of the South African consulate; divestiture of government funds invested in banks or corporations doing business with South Africa; a ban on the sale of Krugerrands, South African gold coins; denial of landing rights to South African aircraft in the U.S.; and a prohibition on any informational or cultural government-to-government ties.


Both Sessoms and Garling stressed the importance of economic ties in maintaining the apartheid regime in power. Washington state, they noted, is a major economic partner of South Africa.


According to the Washington Department of Commerce and Economic Development, South Africa was this state's 10th leading trade partner in 1982, ranking ahead of all nations in Europe and Latin America. Over $388 million of goods moved between South Africa and Washington in that year.


Imports of beryllium and lead ore and the export of aircraft accounted for 97 percent of this amount. The state government added to this total during fiscal 1983, when the Liquor Control Board purchased $24,000 worth of goods directly from South Africa for sale in its stores. The Port of Seattle reports 4,700 metric tons of goods entered from South Africa in 1982.


Demonstrations and arrests are continuing to mount each week as more and more groups and individuals come forward to add their voice to the struggle.


Senator George Fleming recently announced he will introduce a bill in the next session of the state legislature directed at removing the South African presence from our state. Jesse Wineberry will introduce companion legislation in the House, and Mayor Charles Royer has instructed his staff to investigate the city's investment portfolio with an eye toward divesting in South Africa.

Eighteen Asian activists -- including King County Council candidate Bob Santos -- were among the 58 demonstrators arrested on criminal trespassing charges last Sunday in front of the home of the honorary South African consul in Seattle.


The 58 demonstrators, who walked up to the door of South African consul Joseph Swing in 10 separate groups, were arrested by waiting police officers who handcuffed them and ushered them down to a van which transported them to the nearby Bush School where each was issued a citation, then released.


As the trespassers were led away, a crowd of about 500 people, carrying banners and pickets calling for closure of the Seattle consulate and severance of local ties to the South African regime, chanted, ""Freedom, yes! Apartheid, no!"" The 18 Asians arrested were: Doug Chin, Viqui Claravell, David Della, Ticiang Diangson, Cindy Domingo, Ricardo Farinas, John Foz, Frank Kiuchi, Jeanette Lazam, Andy Mizuki, Diane Narasaki, Marlene Pedregosa, Sandy Rowell, Bob Santos, Danny Santos, Stan Shikuma, Michio Teshima and Irene Woo.


Santos, director of the International District Improvement Association, led a group from the Filipino community up to the consul's door. Santos -- whose son, Danny, was in the group -- told the crowd that both the Marcos regime in the Philippines and the Botha regime in South Africa would collapse without U.S. support.


Later, Diane Narasaki, associate executive secretary of the American Friends Service Committee in Seattle, told the crowd that, several months ago, over 80 percent of the Asians in South Africa, standing ""in solidarity with the Black majority,"" boycotted an election which would have given them limited representation in the parliament, but continued to shut out Blacks.


Asian Americans ""know what it is like to be denied citizenship rights based on race,"" Narasaki said. She noted that Japanese Americans were moved to desolate camps during World War II. ""They were called relocation camps, but they could have been called homelands,"" she said, alluding to the South African government's policy of establishing Black ""homelands"" on barren land.


Irene Woo, International District Housing Alliance member and coordinator of the International District Community Garden, said she participated in the protest ""to show that, as minorities in this country, we will not stand for discrimination under the system of apartheid."" She also noted that Asians in South Africa, including the Chinese, are denied full rights under the present form of government.


There have been demonstrations in front of Swing's Madison Park home every Sunday since December 9. Last Sunday's arrests, brings the total arrested for trespassing to 100.


The Seattle demonstrations are part of the recent crescendo of nationwide protests aimed at pressuring the South African government to end its practice of apartheid, which the United Nations has branded ""a crime against humanity.""


In a recent policy change, City Attorney Doug Jewett has announced that he intends to begin prosecuting trespassers, including the five persons arrested January 13. Charges were previously dismissed at the City Attorney's discretion. Criminal trespass, a misdemeanor offense, carries a maximum penalty of one year in jail and a $5,000 fine, but the City Attorney's office is expected to request only that defendants pay court and police costs in the prosecution of their cases.


The demonstrators charge that Reagan's policy of ""constructive engagement"" allows the U.S. to criticize the apartheid regime in words, while protecting and supporting it in deeds. ""It looks like constructive engagement has now been established here in Seattle,"" Stan Shikuma said. ""The city would never allow a gambling house or bordello to operate here: If a South African consulate is not a house of ill repute, I don't know what is.""


On Monday, the King County Council, lacking a quorum, delayed until next week any action on a resolution calling for the County to refrain from business with the South African regime. Council member Cynthia Sullivan introduced the resolution. Earlier, the Council members deadlocked three to three over a similar resolution.


Paul Barden, one of those who voted no, said he does not oppose the resolution, but had questions about the specific ramifications of the resolution on the local economy.

The Seattle Chapter of the Japanese American Citizens League (JACL), comprised primarily of Nisei and Sansei members, last month paid tribute at its installation banquet to a ""dwindling resource,"" the first generation Issei.


Over 400 people packed the Ocean City Restaurant in the International District to pay tribute ""to the generation that sacrificed their lives in order to give their children a better life than they had."" Approximately 50 Issei attended the banquet, most accompanied by their children and grandchildren.


""The response was really a tremendous outpouring,"" said banquet chairperson Kazzie Katayama. ""I wish we could have done this 10 years earlier, because so many more would have been alive.""


Senator Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, was the keynote speaker. Toshio Isogai, Consul General of Japan, and Rev. Kenneth Miyake were also featured speakers in the program. To show appreciation to the Issei, each of the night's speakers was asked to say something in Japanese.


Each of the Issei who attended the dinner received a packet with a photograph of Japan's Imperial Family, congratulatory letters from President Reagan and the Consul General of Japan, a red and white mochi, the JACL 60th Anniversary Tribute pin and a hand-made corsage.


""I really think we made a lot of people happy,"" said Katayama. ""The Issei were just tickled that we were making such a fuss over them, taking their pictures and putting them in the newspaper. One said, 'I wouldn't have missed it for the world.'""


The JACL has also constructed a plaque inscribed with, over 200 names of deceased Issei. There are 70 more names yet to be put up, pending construction of another board. The plaques will be housed in the Seattle JACL office.


The inscription reads: ""In grateful recognition to the Issei pioneers who contributed so much to their adopted country, the United States. They persevered through racial barriers by unsung hard work and countless sacrifices. They nurtured families now recognized for notable achievements in all fields. The Japanese American Citizens League, the Seattle Chapter, hereby pays lasting tribute to all of those Issei pioneers, too numerous to name individually. This plaque honors the following pioneers, no longer with us, whose names were submitted by families and friends.""


""We didn't know what the response was going to be,"" said Katayama. ""We didn't know if we would get one name, or just how many. We first got a board to fit 40 names, but then we kept on getting more and more names.


""I think there was a real need to do this or we wouldn't have had the response we did.""


U.S. Sen. Daniel Inouye, who has spent 25 years in Congress, told those at the banquet about his feelings for the Issei.


""Those who came to the United States were poor failures in their own communities in Japan,"" Inouye said. ""Their legacy is much more important than gold or vast estates.


""They told us how to recognize honor, loyalty and duty. They taught us to persevere, the importance of education and to be grateful to others.""


Inouye, co-sponsor of a bill to provide redress to former internees, reminded the audience that it will be difficult to pass legislation, especially since so many Americans are still unaware of the internment. But he remains optimistic: ""I will do my best, but it will take some time. I've yet to lose a battle in my 25 years in Congress, and I don't intend to lose this one.""


Certificates of appreciation were presented to members and supporters of JACL: Theresa Takayoshi - (posthumously); Ken Nakano, T.J. Vassar, Dolores Sibonga, Mayor Charles Royer, and Arthur Barnett.


Others honored were: May Sasaki, Eira Nagaoka (posthumously), Chuck Kato, Ben Nakagawa and Ted Taniguchi.


The 1985 Seattle JACL Chapter officers are: David Okimoto, president; Robert Sato, president-elect; Wayne Kimura, first vice-president; Sam Shoji, second vice-president; Roger Shimizu, third vice-president; Ellen Miyasato, fourth vice-president; Vicki Toyohara, recording secreatary; Ayako Hurd, corresponding secretary; Gail Tanaka, treasurer; and Jerry Shigaki, past president.


Board members are: Ann Fujii, David Hoekendorf, Chuck Kato, Cherry Kinoshita, Al Kimura, Kent Nakano, Gordon Sata, Kara Tokita, Sharon Harada, Rod Kaseguma, Diana Kato, Jan Kumasaka, Akiko Kurose, Janice Nishimori, Ed Suguro, Massie Tomita, James Hattori, Kazzie Katayama, Don Kazama, Art Kuniyuki, Hana Masuda, Arlene Oki, Ted Taniguchi and Ken Katayama.

""You must be able to set aside your personality for the good of a cause,"" Senator Dan Inouye (D-Hawaii) told the executive board of the Asian/Pacific Democratic Caucus of Washington (APDCW) last month.


Inouye was keynote speaker at the Japanese American Citizens League (JACL) installation banquet January 26 at the Ocean City Restaurant (See story on page 2). He met with the board of the recently formed caucus for an hour the following day.


""Number one, don't be exclusive,"" he advised. Inouye, the first Japanese American elected to Congress and the third ranking Democrat in the Senate, told the APDCW board that he often finds caucuses built around a personality. Someone will decide ""to become something other than a footnote,"" Inouye explained, and that person will then gather similar people to be surrounded by. ""Go out of your way to break the barriers,"" the senator urged.


""If you want to make your political mark, you're not going to do it with a social club.""


The Democrats haven't done enough research on Asian and Pacific Americans or ""made an effort to go out and grab"" new members from the different Asian American ethnic groups, Inouye said. He urged the Seattle caucus to ""go out and recruit"" members from less recognized Asian American groups, and have an available ""roster"" of people in the community to recommend for appointments.


""You have the opportunity,"" the senior senator from Hawaii told the APDCW group. ""Your hands are not tied by the stupid cultural restrictions"" of other generations, he said.


Inouye became the first Japanese American in the House when elected in 1959, and became the first Japanese American U.S. Senator in 1963. As the third most senior Democrat in the Senate, the veteran of the 442nd Regimental Combat Unit is a very powerful national figure. He is secretary of the Steering and Policy Committee and is the ranking Democrat on the Appropriations Committee. In addition, he currently serves on the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, and is a member of the Select Committee on Intelligence.


Arlene Oki, recording secretary of the caucus, asked Inouye if he would consider seeking the leadership of his party in the senate. Inouye said he has ""had occasion"" where his colleagues submitted a petition, signed by a majority, asking him to be leader, but ""I like my free life.""


""In the public sector I work very hard,"" Inouye explained, ""but once I get in my car and drive home, that's it.""


""I value my privacy,"" he added. But he told the caucus that 1986 may be the year the Democrats take control of the Senate, in which case he may find the position of party leader ""irresistible.""


Inouye said he was ""offered the 1968 vice presidential nomination on a silver platter,"" but that, from a personal standpoint, he ""wanted no part of that.""


""I was deeply flattered,"" he said, but ""did not think my presence on the ticket would help.""


Because of his committee positions, the Honolulu native said, he is part of many important decisions in Washington, D.C. ""On top of that I'm getting very senior,"" he said. If he lives ""long enough"" and decides to run for two more senate terms, ""I'm certain to be president of the country,"" he joked.


Inouye is co-sponsor of the senate bill to provide redress to Japanese Americans incarcerated during World War II. He told the APDCW board that the reparations process is ""proceeding according to our timetable."" The senator said he had met briefly with Cherry Kinoshita, of the Washington Coalition on Redress, telling her she ""had her work cut out"" for her.


""You're going to find that, as time goes by, your opposition will come about in strange ways from your so-called natural allies,"" Inouye told the caucus.


The senator pointed out that the U.S. has not apologized to a number of racial groups -- including Blacks, Native Americans and Hawaiians -- for treatment they received from the government.


""At this stage the comments won't be so formidable,"" the senator said. But ""when you get close to the goal, that's when the ugliness will come out.""


Inouye told the caucus he had related a story at the JACL banquet about an Italian American function in Washington, D.C. last year to which President Reagan and other powerful political people were invited. At the Washington function, sponsored by an organization with a smaller membership than the JACL, Italian and U.S. flags were waved, and the group sang the national anthems of both countries. Inouye asked the JACL banquet audience if they could imagine the reaction if the JACL were to sponsor a similar event.


Senator Inouye explained to the caucus that he had told the story to give a ""flavor"" of how much more Japanese Americans have to do to be accepted in the United States. ""When we still have incidents such as the killing of a Chinese in Detroit because he looked Japanese"" or the murders of Southeast Asian fishermen in Texas or news stories about Asian gangs, ""we have some image problems,"" he said.

In one year, close to $1 billion has been spent on research for President Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative or ""Star Wars"" missile defense system. The President is asking the American people and their elected officials to support this super high technology program which will cost another $26 billion for research and development over the next five years.


While debate over this defense system rages in the press, the halls of Congress, among the general public and within the ""peace community,"" the impact of this ultra-modern and super expensive weapons system is already being felt by people in the Pacific. Most of the research, development and testing of this system is being done in and around the world's largest atoll: Kwaialein. This atoll is the ""target site"" of the Pacific Missile Range -- officially called the Kwajalein Missile Range -- where virtually all of America's Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles; Submarine Launched Ballistic Missiles and other long range delivery and warhead systems are tested.


Kwajalein is located in the Marshall Islands, where the U.S. exploded 66 atomic and hydrogen bombs between 1946 and 1959. While the Reagan administration quietly condemns South Africa's racist apartheid government, military and civilian institutions on Kwajalein practice racial segregation and other racist policies against the indigenous population.


The people living in Kwajalein were moved to a slum built by the U.S. on Ebeye Island. Ebeye has few amenities, cannot support the population there and has tremendous health hazards. Even water has to be barged in three days a week.


The American community on Kwajalein, however, has baseball fields, a golf course and all the other modern conveniences found in any U.S. city. The Marshallese are not allowed to use the facilities there; in fact, only those employed by the base even get on the island, and they must have passes and are shipped in and out each work day.


Resistance to these policies and conditions has been occurring since 1969. Two recent heavily publicized events show that the indigenous population is more determined than ever to gain greater control over their lives, lands and ocean. In 1982, more than 1,000 landowners resettled 11 of the islands they had been removed from in a four month protest called ""Operation Homecoming."" Last December, many of the landowners filed a lawsuit in federal court, calling for at least a temporary halt to operations at the missile range.


If this resistance is successful, the testing of such weapons systems as the Minuteman and MX missiles could be halted, dealing a blow to Reagan's ""Star Wars"" program.


But if the testing continues, the arms buildup will escalate and local inhabitants will continue to live under a U.S. government system of apartheid.


The majority of those in the predominantly White peace movement have focused on the ""hardware"" aspects of ""Star Wars."" The poor and Third World communities have focused on issues of military and social spending priorities.


Asian and Pacific Americans need to also oppose our government's racist policies and support the rights of the people in the Marshall Islands.

If Congress approves President Reagan's proposal to eliminate discretionary money for rail and transit projects, Metro would not have enough money to complete a proposed 1.3 mile bus tunnel through Seattle's downtown, David Kalberer, project manager said at an open house in the International District late last month.


Kalberer and other Metro officials, accompanied by an informational display, came down to the Bush-Asia Center on February 28 to answer questions about the tunnel project, touted as a solution to downtown transit congestion.


The electrified tunnel, which would run under Third Avenue and Pine Street, would provide a two-lane underground roadway for buses, fed by five passenger stations along the route.


Dual-power buses approaching downtown would switch from diesel to electric power and enter the tunnel in platoons of three or four buses.


The downtown project also includes plans to increase bus service on surface streets and improve streets and sidewalks along the tunnel alignment.


Kalberer said the project stands to lose $170 million to $190 million in federal Urban Mass Transportation Administration (UMTA) funds, about 50 percent of the money Metro needs to construct the tunnel, if Reagan's proposal is enacted.


""There are not sufficient local funds to replace those federal dollars,"" Kalberer said.


Kalberer said Congress has rejected previous attempts to cut UMTA funds over the past several years, but that, this year, Congress may be ""more sensitive"" to such a proposal because of the burgeoning problem of the budget deficit.


However, Kalberer said, Metro will proceed with the bus tunnel project ""assuming the federal money will be coming.""


Kalberer said the project's Environmental Impact Statement will be completed and made public in May, with preliminary engineering to begin in mid-May.


One of the five passenger stations would be constructed at the historic Union Station building, adjacent to the International District. Upland Industries, the development arm of Union Pacific Railroad, is also eyeing Union Station as the site for developing a new civic center to house all city workers.


The Metro station and the civic center proposal ""are projects being conceived together,"" Kalberer said.


Under Metro's proposal, the site behind the Union Station building would be lidded, eliminating ""the hole in the ground,"" Kalberer said. A station platform would be constructed on the east side of the building, between South Jackson and Weller Streets.


Development of Union Station would benefit the International District, Kalberer said, ""by bringing activity to the edge of the community.""

President Reagan recently assured Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos that the U.S. ""stands with you and the Philippine people as you seek to resolve your nation's difficult economic problems."" The future of the Philippines, Reagan told Marcos, ""is important not only to your own people, but to mine as well . . ."" He added that his administration was ""working with all Filipinos of moderate political views to revitalize and strengthen your democratic institutions.""


These statements confirm the new U.S. scheme, euphemistically called the ""revitalization of democratic institutions and processes."" It involves revival of the socalled two party system, under which two factions of the same ruling class alternate in power under the auspices and in subservience to the U.S. Observers have even described this scheme as ""preparing a U.S.-Marcos dictatorship without Marcos.""


The strategy is to win over Filipinos of moderate political views and isolate Filipinos of radical political views to achieve political stability favorable to the U.S.


Taking his cue from Reagan's message, Marcos recently called for dialogue with his political opposition. This shows the decisive role played by the U.S. in Philippine ruling class politics and in every major step taken by the elite. Grasping the U.S. role is key to understanding important current events.


The fixed position of the U.S. and Marcos is to exterminate the Left. The recent statements of departing U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Paul D. Wolfowitz and Assistant Defense Secretary Richard Lee Armitage contained the message that the U.S. views the Communist threat to the Philippines a ""very serious problem"" that calls for social and economic reforms as well as military action, and ""strongly"" supports the country's effort to resolve it.


Wolfowitz handed Reagan's message to Marcos. He said the U.S. shared the view of Philippine officials on the need for a comprehensive program to counter the insurgency threat. Armitage, for his own part, said that dealing successfully with dissidents would necessarily involve a wide range of social and economic reforms. Security assistance, though ancillary, is essential to allow the broader reforms to be accomplished in an atmosphere of security and stability.


The U.S., in addition to helping determine and meet specific Philippine counter-insurgency needs, is trying to halt the deterioration of the Philippine armed forces, including rescuing it from cronyism, as in the case of General Fabian Ver.


On the other hand, Prime Minister Virata has earlier said that the country will step up its rural development efforts with more U.S. economic aid to stop growing. Communist insurgency. This supports similar efforts by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).


The World Bank and IMF have pushed for dismantling state-enforced marketing monopolies in the sugar and coconut industries. Not that the U.S. is against monopolies. It just does not want Filipino monopolies to get in the way of U.S. monopolies.


The dismantling of the local sugar and coconut monopolies is clearly one of the conditions for granting a $609 million standby loan to the Philippines. This, in turn, is supposed to pave the way for a $11 billion economic recovery program. But analysis and events will show that the IMF recovery package means only ""breathing space"" for the U.S.-supported Marcos regime, but ""added misery to the Filipino people.""


Clearly, Marcos is giving in to U.S. pressure. Apparently, to Marcos, ""everything's negotiable"" except his personal abdication. In the joint dictatorship of Marcos and the U.S., it is the latter that plays the dominant role.

The ruling regime in Seoul would be ""quite likely to lose"" a free election in South Korea today, said a University of Washington (UW) professor who was a member of the American delegation that accompanied dissident leader Kim Dae Jung on his return to South Korea.


Bruce Cumings, an associate professor at the Jackson School of International Studies, said that news reports on South Korea tend to emphasize the relative success of a developing economy, but that the real story in Korea today is the ""growing opposition"" to South Korean President Chun Doo Hwan.


Cumings, UW Korean history specialist James Palais and Jean Kim of the Korean Human Rights Council spoke at the World Affairs Council's ""First Thursday"" meeting in the Market Meeting Place on March 7.


Cumings said the American delegation that accompanied Kim Dae Jung to South Korea sought to draw attention to the relationship between the U.S. and South Korea and protect Kim from being assassinated in the same manner as Filipino opposition leader Benigno Aquino when he returned to the Philippines.


Kim, who had been in exile in the United States, had previously been convicted of sedition on what the U.S. State Department called ""trumped up charges.""


Following the much-publicized Kimpo Airport scuffle between the Americans and Korean security police, ""we thought we had failed to protect Kim,"" said Cumings. The delegation was separated from Kim by police and only learned three hours later that he was under house arrest.


More significantly, Cumings said, the Americans saw ""tens of thousands"" of Koreans waiting for Kim as they left Kimpo Airport. ""The crowds lasted about two miles,"" Cumings said.


Palais suggested that the treatment accorded the Americans by the Korean security men was directly related to the South Korean relationship with the Reagan administration. ""The current regime feels that because Ronald Reagan won the last election with an overwhelming victory"" and Reagan supports Chun, the South Korean government ""could act with impunity"" toward Americans who did not agree with Reagan, Palais said.


Palais also noted that the U.S. government, rather than supporting democratic forces in South Korea, has consistently supported the ruling regime. Chun took power in the chaos following the assassination of Park Chung Hee, South Korea's previous president, and he ""won it with guns.""


""The U.S. was instrumental in that process,"" Palais said, because it approved the use of military aid to put down uprisings, including student riots in Seoul in 1979 which resulted in numerous deaths.


Jean Kim, a founding member of the Korean Human Rights Council, criticized both the South Korean and U.S. governments for assuming that democratic-minded South Koreans must be Communists, noting that she herself opposes the regime, but is also anti-Communist.


She said she looks with suspicion on news that Kim has been released from house arrest: ""We feel very insecure about his release. The U.S. government has been saying that the North Koreans might assassinate him."" She suggested that if Kim were killed, the South Koreans would blame it on North Korea.


She also disputed the U.S. State Department's assertion that Kim had lost support in South Korea or with Koreans overseas.


Cumings also doubts the State Department. Dissident leaders in South Korea told him, he said, that ""Chun's days are numbered ... the country faces a real political crisis.""


He pointed to student riots last fall that required 6,000 riot police to quell. Even though Kim's political activities have been restricted, he said, the recent South Korean elections -- in which all of the dissident groups fared better than expected -- are a sign that change may be in the offing.

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Under the Reagan administration, Chinese Americans and Asian Americans face uncertainty that their basic civil rights will be protected under the Constitution, Henry K. Mui, executive director of the Organization of Chinese Americans (OCA), said earlier this month.


OCA established in 1973, is a national group with over 4,000 members and 20 chapters in the United States.


Mui, who became OCA director late last year, said civil rights organizations feel that the Justice Department, the U.S. Civil Rights Commission and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) have abandoned vigorous and aggressive enforcement of civil rights.


Mui said the Reagan administration's approach does not call for numerical goals in employment or court-ordered remedies for classes of people.


On February 12, Mui said, the EEOC announced it is moving away from broad complaints against large companies and industries in favor of ""more tightly focused"" discrimination cases involving specific individuals. However, Mui said, class action is needed to remedy institutionalized past and present discrimination.


""We will not see quality litigation for civil rights cases because you will not find quality cases in individual complaints, especially against large companies and institutions,"" Mui said. ""They will only help a person here and there, assuming the victim can afford to hire an attorney and go to court.""


According to records in the OCA national office, he said, many victims of employment discrimination could not afford to hire a good lawyer and often had no choice but to drop their complaints because of time and money. Many Chinese Americans victimized by the system chose to leave quietly rather than file formal complaints, Mui said.


Mui said Chinese Americans registering to vote in Atlanta, Georgia have to check either ""White"" or ""Black"" on the voter registration form. This example, he said, illustrates that Chinese Americans and Asian Americans are still not recognized and treated equally as first class citizens in this country.

Americans should learn the social, political, economic and educational conditions in Central America and work hard to stop U.S. intervention in the region, a group of visiting educators from Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Panama said during a visit to Seattle last month.


The educators, representatives of the Federation of Central American Teachers Organization (FOMCA), visited Seattle as part of a West Coast tour that will include stops in Portland, Eugene, San Francisco, Sacramento, Los Angeles, San Diego and Phoenix.


The visit was sponsored by the Seattle Committee of Teachers in Solidarity with ANDES, the National Association of Salvadoran Educators.


The Seattle Committee of Teachers in Solidarity with ANDES was organized in 1984 to educate students and teachers in the U.S. about current conditions in Central America and El Salvador and gather material support for literacy campaigns.


FOMCA is an independent organization that seeks improvements in the Central American education system. Its goals are to:


-- improve the situation for teachers through establishment of union rights, better working conditions and better teaching resources;


-- stop violations of teachers' human rights and assist teachers and their families who face oppression; and


-- work for a more democratic system of education which would reach the poorest sectors of society and eliminate illiteracy.


At Seattle University, the educators described how U.S. intervention in Central America has historically involved military and economic domination.


Carlos Octavio Escobar, representing the National Association of Salvadoran Educators, said, ""The problem in El Salvador is a problem of social injustice. Fifty thousand people have been assassinated by the U.S.-backed government. Many of the victims were women, elderly and children. Almost 300 were teachers.""


Total U.S. aid to the Salvadoran government increased from $11 million in 1979 to $527 million in 1984. Aid appropriated for 1985 has reached $454 million so far, of which $128 million is for military assistance.


Guatemalan Walter Oswaldo Valencia Garcia, a former college professor and international representative of the National Teachers Front of Guatemala, said, ""We believe it's possible to find a peaceful solution so that the sovereignty of our people is respected.""


Under President Carter, military aid to Guatemala was stopped in response to human rights abuses. Under the Reagan administration, however, military aid was set at $10 million. Although only $300,000 was approved, $12.5 million was approved by Congress in economic support funds.


Maria del Socorro Rodriguez Lagos, president of FOMCA, described her native Nicaragua as a peaceful country, saying that the Nicaraguans have no intention of threatening the national security of the U.S.


She added that, since 1981, the ""Contras"" have killed more than 8,000 people, of whom 214 were teachers. U.S. support to the Contras, she declared, only means ""more blood, pain and sorrow for the people.""


She asked the American public not to support the $14 million in aid to the Contras, sought by the Reagan administration.


Carlos Zuniga, current president of the Honduran Professional Teachers Training Guild, said, ""There's a kind of domination contrary to the desire of my people. The government is repressive and has permitted the installation of a foreign army in our country.""


U.S. aid to Honduras increased from $31 million in 1979 to $286.5 million in 1984. Military aid appropriated for 1985 is $62.5 million. There are six U.S. airbases in the country.


Panamanian educator and secretary general of the Panamanian Teachers Union, Dionisia Cossio Vasquez, briefly explained the history of domination in her country and the very limited resources for education. Between 1983 and 1984, U.S. military aid to Panama tripled from about $5 million to $15 million.


Organizers of this educational tour believe education is based on a mutual exchange of ideas, leading to greater understanding. An important part of the effort to achieve peace in Central America is education of the American public about the conditions of life in that region the political and social repression the people face, the goals they strive for, and the role played by the U.S. government in their countries.

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Sharon Maeda, executive director of Pacifica Radio, a network of five non-commercial, listener sponsored radio stations, was arrested last month on the steps of the South African Embassy, protesting that country's apartheid policy.


She joined over 3,000 Americans who have been arrested in similar nation-wide protests since last Thanks-giving.


Maeda, a Seattle native, said that Pacifica, since its inception in 1946, has been dedicated to peace and understanding among all people.


""Any understanding about the apartheid situation in South Africa requires that all people of conscience speak out against constructive engagement and U.S. support for the racist Botha regime,"" she said.


Maeda, whose parents and grandparents were incarcerated in American concentration camps during World War II, said she feels a strong personal connection to the issue: ""Apartheid in South Africa is worse than taking the Native Americans off their land, slavery and injustic against all oppressed American groups combined. It would not be tolerated today in the U.S. It should not be tolerated anywhere in the world.""


Maeda noted that much of American media is controlled by multi-national corporations with heavy investments in South Africa. ""Apartheid could not survive if the Reagan administration and U.S. corporations pull out,"" she said.


Pacifica's board of Directors voted in January to withdraw all its funds from banks investing in South Africa.


Pacifica, which has provided first exposure for many prominent artists and philosophers, has also defended the First Amendment in many precedent-setting cases.

Asian Americans for Political Action (AAPA), a non-partisan organization formed in the mid-1970s to educate the community about the political process and inform politicians about community issues, will sponsor two events in Seattle.


On June 12, AAPA will invite guests to discuss the topic of ""How to Lobby."" The public meeting will be at the Bush-Asia Center in the International District, 6:30 to 8:30 p.m.


The speakers will be: Joan Yoshitomi, budget analyst for the Senate Ways and Means Committee; Ray Corpuz, director of intergovernmental affairs for the City of Tacoma; Naomi Sanchez, assistant to the Chancellor of the Seattle Community College District; Cherry Kinoshita, Pacific Northwest Regional Redress Coordinator for the Japanese American Citizens League; Pearl McElheran, administrative assistant in the King County Department of Executive Administration; Bob Santos, executive director of Inter Im; Gary Locke, State Representative; and Alan Osaki, legislative aide to City Council member Dolores Sibonga.


Martha Choe, AAPA president and corporate banking officer for the Bank of California, said the speakers will ""exchange war stories and lessons learned from community activists . . . to get issues heard or legislation passed.""


On August 14, AAPA will host a candidates forum at Seattle University, featuring the major election races in Seattle and King County. The forum will be moderated by KING-TV news reporter James Hattori and include questions from a panel and the audience.


AAPA will invite candidates in the following races: King County Executive, Seattle Mayor, King County Council, Seattle City Council, Port Commission and Seattle School Board.


A reception for the candidates will be held 5:30 to 6 p.m., followed by the forum in the Lemieux Library, 6 to 10 p.m.


Choe said AAPA is inviting community organizations to co-sponsor the forum.


In the past, she said, AAPA has endorsed candidates for office, but the group has not decided whether to do it this year.


Choe pointed out that AAPA, which she describes as ""a watchdog for community concerns,"" is ""in a revitalization period; trying to encourage new members and inject new life into the organization.""


AAPA needs more members so it can form committees to plan other activities, including a ""high visability event"" with a speaker in the fall, Choe said. The organization meets monthly. The annual membership fee is $15.


She said she would like AAPA to ""establish a dialogue with elected and appointed officials to address some of the concerns the community has."" Choe said AAPA supports affirmative action, ""adequate representation of Asians in all levels of the public sector, particularly management and exempt positions.""


""I think we find more people are wanting to become involved because of things happening on the federal level with Reagan's policies,"" Choe said.


For information about AAPA, call Choe at 325-3735.

After more than a decade of autocratic rule under Perdinand Marcos, the Philippines continues to experience economic difficulties and political instability.


In 1981, the Agency for International Development revealed that as many as four million households live below the poverty level. No studies have contradicted this. In 1984, the faculty of the School of Economics of the University of the Philippines reported that the assassination of opposition leader Benigno Aquino ""simply tore through the already weakened fabric of the economy.""


The regime's own figure of 6.8 million Filipinos unemployed and underemployed speaks of the ever-increasing unemployment rate.


The government has sought to integrate the unemployed into an economic policy based on the exploitation of labor. As a result, thousands of Filipinos who can hardly make both ends meet are forced to go abroad for jobs, even if it means exploitation by foreign masters and separation from families.


The government needs the dollars of Filipino workers abroad to reduce its perennial balance of payment deficit and to pay its huge foreign debt, now over $30 billion.


To make sure foreign workers surrender their dollars, Marcos created Executive Order 857, requiring those working abroad to remit 50 to 70 percent of their earnings through government-controlled banks. Failure to comply means the worker's passport will not be renewed and the worker will be blacklisted from the government's overseas employment program.


To date, 1.6 million Filipino workers and professionals earn a living in 124 other countries.


The value of the peso also continues to drop while the price of basic commodities continues to increase. Last year, the Central Bank overstated its foreign reserves by almost six hundred million. Overborrowing by the government and, ""crony capitalists who manipulated their ties to Marcos and state agencies to build economic empires"" have led the economy to what one oppositionist calls a ""very grave crisis.""


To make matters worse, the international Monetary Fund, the ""rescuer"" of the Philippine economy, has imposed harsh prerequisites on release of standby credit to the country, including new domestic taxes, reduction of spending, and continued adoption of export-oriented industrialization which stunts ""the expansion of the domestic market since production was essentially geared toward the market of advanced industrial countries.""


Marcos did not foresee that the Aquino assassination would instantly trigger mass actions and demonstrations that would politicize hundreds from different social backgrounds.


Legal oppositionists from the ranks of traditional politicians, many of whom are longstanding friends of the regime, have now organized for electoral battle with Marcos.


These politicians include; Salvador Laurel, UNIDO president, and Eva Kalaw, head of one faction of the Liberal Party Both strongly support the U.S. military bases and harshly criticize the people's national and democratic organizations.


Last March 20, a new coalition was formed. According to former Senator Jose Dioknc, the coalition, calling itself BAYAN (Bagong Alyansang Makabayan), is a unified leadership of all people's organizations based on pro-people, anti-imperialist and anti-dictatorship ideas. Bayan centers on issues, not personalities. Its National Council includes: former Senators Lorenzo Tanada and Jose Diokno, Butz Aquino, brother of the slain senator, Loretta Ann Rosales, chair of the Alliance of Concerned Teachers, and labor leader Rolando Olalia, of the militant Kilusang Mayo Uno.


The radical National Democratic Front (NDF) also opposes Marcos. Its program calling for: an end to dictatorship and foreign domination through armed struggle; genuine freedom and democracy; unhampered economic development; support for the democratic rights of all Filipinos, including the Muslims and other minority groups.


The military arm of the NDF is the New people's Army (NPA). In 1984, the NPA increased its number of full-time and part-time guerrillas from 20,000 in December, 1983 to an estimated 30,000. There are more than 59 guerrilla fronts in 59 of the 73 provinces. The number of local militia is estimated at 20,000.


Meanwhile, U.S. military intervention is apparently escalating. Through the Joint U.S. Military Advisory Group and the U.S. Agency for International Development and of course, with the support of Reagan, the U.S. has provided military assistance in the form of training and equipment.


While pressuring Marcos to make concessions to traditional legal oppositionists, the Reagan administration has stepped up its support for the Philippine Armed Forces. For fiscal year 1986, the Philippines will get $195 million in military and economic aid: M16s, machine guns, tanks, helicopters, troopships and communications equipment.


U.S. military advisors have already been sent to the Philippines. Former Foreign Minister Arturo Tolentino, who confirmed their presence, fell from favor with Marcos, finally resigning from his cabinet position a few months ago.


The Philippines is like a volcano ready to explode. Much to the chagrin of the U.S., both legal and armed struggles against Marcos continue to escalate. Assured of continued U.S. support, Marcos's logical response is more violence and repression.


The slaying of Father Tulio Savali, an Italian missionary . . . gunned down by the government para-military Civilian Home Defense Force last April 11, is the latest example of such violence. But as Marcos continues to employ repressive measures, it is likely more and more Filipinos will resist him.

This year, the Examiner mailed questionnaires to candidates for each of the following positions: Seattle Mayor, King County Executive, King County Council Position 5, Seattle City Council, Seattle School Board and Seattle Port Commission.


Surprise of surprises, almost all the major candidates chose to respond. Now we print their responses. Read what they have to say. Then vote. The primary election is just around the corner: Tuesday, September 17.


-- Editor


SEATTLE MAYOR


How does your personal and professional experience equip you to respond knowlegeably and sensitively to issues in the Asian Pacific American communities?


Charles Royer: One of the Democratic values I grew up with, and one that I take to the office every day, is my commitment to the proposition that no individual's civil rights should be compromised in any way. To campaign for human rights for all people is the absolute foundation of the Democratic Party agenda -- in fact, the American agenda -- and that campaign begins here at home.


I have carried these personal values and beliefs into my job as Mayor and worked to support those for whom the doors were closed in the past. As your Mayor for the past 7 and 1/2 years, I have worked tirelessly to achieve economic, social and political equality for all of Seattle's citizens.


As an example, I supported redress payments to Japanese Americans who were forced out of their City jobs in 1942 and successfully got the National League of Cities and the U.S. Conference of Mayors to support the recommendations of the U.S. Commission on Wartime Relocation, including monetary payments to Aleuts and Japanese Americans.


Norm Rice: My activities with the Seattle Urban League have included work on the Media Action project assisting JACL in its efforts to eliminate offensive local and national commercials which depicted Asians in a negative manner.


Asians have been chairs and campaign managers of my Council campaigns and have been and are currently represented on my past and present steering committees. Asians have served as interns in my Council office.


I have been an outspoken advocate for affirmative action hiring practices and have worked to gain passage of the Women and Minority Business Enterprise Ordinances.


Finally, my human services perspective for Seattle meets the needs of the Asian community as relates to medical and vital service needs, concerns for our youth-at-risk, survival services and elderly concerns.


What specific steps will you take to ensure that Asian Pacific Americans are adequately represented at all levels of the City workforce, including administrative positions and on your personal staff?


Royer: My record of hiring Asians and other minorities is one of which I am proud. I have appointed Asians as directors of the Department of Human Resources and the Purchasing Department. I have also appointed two Asians to my personal, professional staff.


In addition, we have a number of Asians as division directors and assistant department heads, and a homegrown Franklin High School graduate as municipal court judge. And we just hired the first female Asian police officer in Seattle's history. Yet, there is always more that can be done -- old barriers to be torn down -- as we strive to make our City government reflect the city it serves, and I will continue to meet that challenge every day.


Rice: I believe that we must vigorously enforce our existing laws and procedures concerning affirmative action and upward mobility. The current administration has not given this the priority it deserves. I firmly believe that my cabinet as well as my office staff will reflect the Asian community as well as the ethnic and cultural diversity of Seattle as a whole.


Upland Industries is preparing a plan to develop the Union Station site, on the western edge of the International District, into a new city hall office complex. What specific factors would influence your decision whether to support such a plan?


Royer: As Mayor, my greatest challenge is to continue our strong economic growth without threatening the quality of life in our neighborhoods.


In the International District, we have had strong economic development, and the challenge now facing us is how we get the whole Union Station corridor from Dearborn to Yesler developed in a way that recognizes the needs of the neighborhood.


We also have a City government building which is not adequate for our future needs and City employees spread out all over town because of our shortage of space. I established a seven member advisory committee to look at the plans for the Union Station Corridor, with three members from the International District. They are now completing development guidelines which we will follow before allowing anything to be built.


Rice: I favor a plan which will encourage pedestrian activity and minimize traffic impact. We want to encourage the retail activities without creating a traffic bottle-neck, especially given that the transit tunnel will impact this area.


I believe that City Hall should be located so that it is accessible to all citizens and any plan developed must address this concern.


KING COUNTY EXECUTIVE


How does your personal and professional experience equip you to respond knowledgeably and sensitively to issues in the Asian Pacific American communities?


Randy Revelle: Serving eight years as a Seattle City Councilman, I worked closely with Asian community leaders and agencies on issues of importance to the Asian Pacific American communities, including protecting the International District from the impacts of the Kingdome, providing affordable health care and ensuring equal employment opportunity.


Similarly, my four years as King County Executive have given me an understanding and appreciation for the strengths and needs of the Asian Pacific American communities. For example, I have worked on issues of concern to Southeast Asian refugees, including health care, employment, bilingual services and the Indochinese Farm Project.


I have supported other critical programs assisting Asians, particularly in the area of human services. For example, we have increased mental health funding for Asians by 65 percent through the Asian Counseling and Referral Service.


I work closely with Asian leaders in my Administration, including Peter Jamero, Joanne Asaba, Bruce Miyahara, Alan Momohara, May Lui, Elaine Ko and Carol Locke. I have also involved Asians in a variety of roles in my re-election campaign.


Jim Wright: I have had an excellent rapport with the Asian Pacific communities for years. Personally, because I am a man from the southern part of our country and am sensitive to minorities and women, especially. As a Seattle Port Commissioner for the past two years, I have traveled extensively throughout the world and believe I understand the various problems of the communities.


What specific steps will you take to ensure that Asian Pacific Americans are adequately represented at all levels of the County workforce, including administrative positions and on your personal staff?


Revelle: As King County Executive, I have already taken a number of steps ensuring Asian Pacific Americans are adequately represented in County government.


First, we prepared and implemented improved affirmative action plans. We implemented these plans by recruiting qualified minorities, eliminating discriminatory hiring criteria, and promoting the upward mobility of minorities in our workforce of about 4,000, from 16.7 percent in 1981 to 20.6 percent in 1985.


Second, we recruited and hired qualified Asians in key management and professional positions in County government. In 1985, 24 (10 percent) of our 241 management employees are Asian. Of the 72 management and professional employees I personally hired, nine (about 13 percent) are Asian.


Third, my administration implemented an effective Contract Compliance Program to ensure County contractors are meeting our affirmative action goals for hiring minorities.


Fourth, we developed and implemented one of the strongest Minority/Women's Business ordinances in the nation to promote equal opportunity in County contracting.


Wright: I spearheaded the drive to open Port businesses to minorities. That is an accomplished fact. I will continue this whether as Port Commissioner or as King County Executive. I will insist also on this with my personal staff.


Describe how your funding priorities differ from those of the other candidates in the race. How would the Asian Pacific community benefit from your funding priorities?


Revelle: My funding priorities include: improving health care and human services, fostering equal opportunity, promoting responsible economic development, and improving the lives of our troubled youth. The Asian Pacific American community has already benefited and would continue to benefit from my funding priorities during my second term in many ways.


My administration has increased funding for community health clinics throughout King County, and has targeted funds for the Asian community. For example, we help fund tuberculosis screening for Indochinese refugees primary health care services provided by the International District Health Clinic; and translation services provided by the Indochinese Language Bank to people in need of health care.


We have provided funding to many human service agencies in the Asian community, including the Southeast Asian Women's Alliance and the Chinese Information Center.


We have also funded a Minority Access Project for the developmentally disabled in the Asian community to remove barriers to services for the non-English-speaking. In addition, our Summer Work Training Program employs over 500 Asian refugee youth, representing 33 percent of the total youth served.


My administration increased staff in our Affirmative Action Office to strengthen implementation of our affirmative action plans and our Minority Women's Business Ordinance.


Wright: Because I am aware of the many problems of the Asian Pacific American community throughout the world, I'm convinced I am the man who can insist the A.P.A. community receive its rightful priority funding. I am not aware that Mr. Hill or Mr. Revelle (either one) have demonstrated that they are able to make decisions either for or against the Asian Pacific American community.


KING COUNTY COUNCIL POSITION 5


How does your personal and professional experience equip you to respond knowlegeably and sensitively to issues in the Asian Pacific American communities?


Willie Campbell: Growing up in the culturally and racially mixed environment of Seattle-King County, I cannot remember when I did not know of the depth of feeling regarding the ""family"" in the Asian community: the father as true head of the household, the reverence and respect given to elders by virtue of their longevity and knowledge, and manners -- the means of showing mutual respect.


Experiencing these feelings and observing them firsthand has allowed me to diversify my personal involvement with community organizations including volunteering as an official of the St. Peter's Asian Basketball League, board member of the Holly Park Medical Clinic, NAACP Membership Drive volunteer, Central Area Jaycee, Rainier District POW-WOW, and official for Special Olympic Swim Event held at South Shore.


Professionally, from receiving a degree in Education, Seattle University, to two years experience with Boys Club of Seattle and King County to the past 10 years with Seattle Department of Parks and Recreation are indicative on my concern with youth, all youth, for they are our future.


My current position with Seattle Parks and Recreation ensures my participation in the Summer Youth Employment Program with approximately 15 to 20 percent of my staff being of Asian lineage and the Summer Lunch program, serving approximately the same percentage of Asians are indicative of not only my firm commitment to Asians, but all members, races, religions, creeds, of King County.


Cheryl Chow: Throughout my 15 year professional career and 20 years of community service, I have worked directly with students, parents and community leaders of the Asian Pacific communities.


As a teacher and building principal and vice principal, I planned and organized clubs and activities for Asian and Pacific students so that they could have a forum to discuss goals and plan and carry out activities. As well as being an advisor, I invited members of the communities to participate by becoming advisors and resource persons who taught various aspects of the student's native cultures. I also pulled in community people to help youth and families deal with concerns and issues.


I have promoted Asian Pacific participation in sports and varied school and community activities. I helped start an open girls and women's Asian basketball league and continue to volunteer coach. I am an instructor for the Seattle Chinese Community Girls' Drill Team.


Through my professional and volunteer work, I have counseled youth and parents who were in or approaching crisis situations. I have also helped in many activities for the Asian elderly.


As an active participant in a variety of Asian Pacific communities and activities, I will be an active voice for the Asian Pacific and total communities within the 5th District.


Bob Santos: I have over 30 years of community involvement and professional experience working on issues affecting Asians as well as other minority and nonminority groups. I was executive director of the International District Improvement Association for the last 14 years. In addition, I served on many community boards and commissions such as the State Commission on Asian American Affairs, Human Rights Commission, Demonstration Project for Asian Americans and White House Conference on the Elderly. I worked with and understand all Asians -- Chinese, Japanese, Filipinos, Koreans, Vietnamese and so forth.


What distinguishes me from the other candidates is the depth and breadth of my experience and performance. I have been involved in civil rights, housing, social services, employment, transportation, education, elderly, youth and neighborhood issues. I played a major role in addressing problems facing Asians by starting new agencies like the ID Health Clinic, Denise Louie Child Care Center and the Chinatown-International District Preservation and Development Authority. As the director of Inter-Im, I started the Community Garden, got funds to build over 700 housing units and got City Hall to build a park and the police to patrol the streets. Over $10 million of public and private money have been invested in the ID in the last six years for housing and business development through my leadership.


Ron Sims: As Leadership Coordinator for Senator George Fleming, I played a key role in developing and helping with the passage of a number of legislation impacting the Asian community. I worked closely with members of the Asian community to understand the priorities and concerns of the community.


I am proud of my achievements in helping gain passage for: a joint memorial to Congress supporting redress; funding for the Wing Luke/Asian American Theater projects; property tax exemption for the International District PDA; redress for state employees; requiring minority and women business participation in the awarding of state contracts; assuring funding for minority mental health programs which directly benefited the Asian Counseling and Referral Service; continued funding for bilingual education; providing primary health care funds that benefited the International District Health Clinic; obtaining emergency food bank funds which will particularly benefit food banks serving the Asian community.


There is still much more that needs to be done and I am personally committed to work for the passage of legislation which will: provide for school employee redress; require business contracting with the state to comply with state affirmative action requirements; and funding for international education in public schools.


Robert Stowers: My professional experience equips me to respond knowledgeably and sensitively to issues in the Asian Pacific communities. First of all, because of my knowledge of Asian Pacific American history, in college I studied issues and historic events that affected the lives, social and economic conditions of Asian Pacific Americans. I was particularly concerned with the plight of the Chinese labor exploitation in the 1800s and early 1900s and the Japanese plight during World War II.


Also, I have worked other Asian Pacific Americans in the Democratic Party developing platform positions on immigration, emergency services, equal opportunity and affirmative action. Additionally, I worked closely with the Washington State Refugee Project when I worked with the Department of Social and Health Services developing policy. All of the above experience would aid me in the County Council.


How do your funding priorities differ from those of the other candidates in the race? How would the Asian Pacific American community benefit from your funding priorities?


Campbell: The real issue here is not the funding priorities of my opponents, but maintaining the existing level of funding.


Currently, President Reagan is making his feelings well known regarding social programs -- CUT. At no time in the history of this country has the need been greater for social programs. King County funds are matched in part by the federal government, and with the proposed substantial cuts recommended by our President, services to Asians and other members of the community would be cut.


We need to fight to maintain the level of services being provided and work toward more efficient utilization of those funds. English as a second language, training programs, housing subsidies all need to be maintained and widely publicized so that not only a few but all elements of the community know they are available. How many Asians realize that the State of Washington guarantees a high school education free to all of its residents?


That is my priority: fight to maintain the current level of funding and provide more widespread knowledge of the programs that are available -- day care, lunch, youth programs, educational programs.


Chow: My first funding priority will be human services. I emphasize human services because people come first on my list of priorities.


For 1985, human services appropriations amounted to only 5.3 percent of the total King County appropriations. This approach is vitally important given greater cutbacks by the federal government and loss of revenue sharing will be occurring in the next few years. Agencies need to be examined to see where overlapping responsibilities occur. These overlapping responsibilities can be consolidated into one agency to oversee. Monies saved in this way may then be allocated to areas which are in need. Areas within human services which need attention are geriatrics, health care, and counseling services for youth in or approaching crisis situations.


Asian Pacific communities will benefit, as will all communities which rely heavily on the above services. The Asian population is the fastest and largest growing minority group in the County. They will need to be made aware that these services exist and how to access them. Some of the needs for this particular group are translation of literature, health education and counseling in their native languages, and translation services for medical and family planning appointments.


My second priority is youth services, which is managed by the Law, Safety and Justice Division. When a youth is incarcerated, there is no provision for psychological testing or counseling or therapy. Our youth are our future. They should not be our future criminals. Since just over 54 percent of the King County budget is allocated for law, safety, and justice, more could be done in the way of preventive programs.


Santos: My priorities are: jobs and economic development; human services and housing; and civil rights.


The 5th District, which extends from Capitol Hill to Renton, has the highest rate of unemployment in the County and stagnant economic growth. For instance, Black unemployment stands at about 20 percent, Asian unemployment 15 percent, while the City's rate is about six percent.


We need job programs and to make sure that people in our district get County jobs. To help businesses start or expand, the County should provide low interest loans and technical assistance, especially in international trade.


We also have the highest percentage of households living in poverty. Nowhere in the County is there a greater need for human service programs and affordable housing than in our district. The need for youth programs, counseling, drug treatment, employment services, health care, child and elderly care among Asians is much greater than most people would have you believe. For certain, the need among Asian refugees is acute.


Affordable housing is another critical area of need. Look at the situation at the Mt. Baker Apartments, where 180 households, mostly Indochinese refugees, live in overcrowded and dilapidated housing.


While some argue that progress has been made in civil rights, we can never let up. I stand for human rights for all -- Asians as well as non-Asians, women as well as men, gays and heterosexuals and crime victims. Fairness, equal opportunities in housing and employment, availability and access to programs and services -- these principles are important to me as a person. I'm determined to fight for these until they become permanently institutionalized.


Sims: I have demonstrated my priorities by the successful passage of the legislation referred to above. My top three funding priorities in King County are: crime reduction and prevention; mental health and job development.


These priorities differ from the other candidates in this race. Crime rate in the 5th District is 400 percent higher than any other area of the County. Crime data indicates that areas with a significant number of Asians are victimized by high incidence of residential burglaries and assaultive activities. Any effort we can make to reduce crime will significantly lessen the number of Asian victims of crime.


In response to priorities established by the Asian Executive Directors, I was instrumental in obtaining funds for Asian mental health needs. I am the only candidate in this race who has proposed legislation necessary to develop a comprehensive mental health program for King County, with emphsis on the needs of the minority communities.


Last session, I worked hard for the passage of the state's affirmative action statute. In addition, I believe that public officials must prod government and private industry to increase the number of Asians in managerial and professional positions and also insure that Asians have access to entry level and mid-level positions. Our state is embarking on a new era of international trade and it is important that Asians occupy key policy and program positions in the area of international trade.


I will continue to support training programs for semi-skilled minority citizens, particularly immigrants and refugees and I will be an active advocate for the creation of these programs for young people and adults.


Stowers: My funding priorities would be concentrated in the areas of economic revitalization and job development. These are areas in which Asian Pacific Americans can use their ingenuity and know-how to open small businesses and create opportunities of employment for other members of the community. This is how all Americans gain economic freedom. Ron Sims' number one priority is crime. Bob Santos is concerned with elderly housing and Cheryl Chow is concerned with more efficient government services.


Elderly housing, low crime rates, and more efficient government have always occurred when the communities were thriving and more self-sufficient. Economically, I proposed a partnership with the private sector, Private Industry Council, local banks to leverage block grant monies along with other funding to strengthen our economic development and expansion; and a relaxing in regulations that hamper business development.


Additionally, we must establish policies and procedures to maintain and create more government jobs. The Asian Pacific community will realize an increase in businesses, jobs, lower crime rates and more efficient social services.


The growing number of Indochinese refugees in King County has increased the burden on social and health service agencies to provide assistance and training. Would you support an increase in County funding for service agencies which target these refugees?


Campbell: I would definitely support an increase in County funding for service agencies targeting refugees. But, as stated in question number two, with the current level of budget cuts being pushed by our government, fighting to maintain the existing level is the real battle.


The Statue of Liberty states: ""Give me your tired, poor, hungry masses..."" We as a democratic nation are taught from birth that we are ""endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights... among them life, liberty and pursuit of happiness.""


Seattle, King County and Washington State are experiencing an influx of persons who have never been exposed to self-government. As future citizens, future participants in the continued growth of the County, yes, spend the money. As any business person will tell you, if you don't spend, how can you get a return on your investment? And, yes, the Indochinese refugees are an investment that we must continue to support.


Chow: Yes, I would support County funding for service agencies which target the growing number of Indochinese refugees. Agencies dealing with refugees should be examined to see if there is any overlapping of services. Money can be saved by consolidation and increased efficiency in delivery of services. Funds saved from overlapping can be redirected toward agencies which are in need.


While addressing needs of the Indochinese refugees with regard to social and health services, we must also address the question of housing and livelihood so that they may eventually become self-supporting. For example, one of Extension Outreach's many programs specifically deals with farming on County surplus land. Although the refugees do not live on that land, they are learning to improve their farming skills so that they may eventually make a living from it.


The problem of housing can be addressed by redirecting funds to Neighborhood House, a non-profit organization which already helps refugees. It would only cost $35,000 to set up in an area in which the refugees may increasingly be moving. Currently, 34 percent of King County Housing Authority housing is comprised of refugees, so organizations like Neighborhood House would help assist in the complexities of various applications and services available.


Santos: I would make sure the County assumes responsibility for helping make up the social service funds that are being cut by the federal and state governments. Equally important, I will make sure that the County provides the 5th District its fair share of funds and that sufficient funding is provided for human service programs for not only the Indochinese, but all those in need.


The County has never provided any of its general fund or current expense fund for social service programs. These are local funds from property taxes and fees, which the County traditionally uses to fund public safety, general government administration and public improvements. I want the County to spend some of this discretionary money to meet human needs.


King County currently provides only a limited amount of funds to programs that primarily serve Indochinese refugees. These are the Chinese Information and Service Center and a health screening program operated by the Seattle-King County Public Health. I think the County can do more to help the refugees get training and jobs, learn English and American customs, receive health care and housing, and deal with the trauma of the war experience. Programs like the Southeast Asian Refugee Forum should receive assistance from the County.


I want the County to provide more funds directly to agencies which primarily serve the refugees. I will also make sure that County services and County-funded programs adequately serve Indochinese community liaison position to inform the County of the special needs of the refugees, recommend ways the County could improve its services to them and be an advocate.


While I will try to see that these things happen, I will not do so at the expense of other groups. Funds should be provided in a fair manner to effective, efficient and deserving programs.


Sims: Yes, I would support continuation of funding for services which target the refugee population. I am committed to insuring that the levels of funding are sufficient to address the needs of that population.


In addition, I intend to address the issues of primary health care needs, employment and training, and housing needs of Southeast Asian refugees.


I want County government to be more responsive to the communities, to eliminate linguistic and cultural barriers that make services inaccessible and underutilized.


Stowers: I would support the continued funding of ongoing social services and emergency services for agencies which aid refugees. I would not support an increase on that criteria alone. I would support an increase if the proportion of the refugee problem in one area was much greater. But only to that particular area.


SEATTLE CITY COUNCIL


How does your personal and professional experience equip you to respond knowlegeably and sensitively to issues in the Asian Pacific American communities?


George E. Benson (Position 1): As a pharmacist and community activist in the Capitol Hill area of Seattle over 25 years, I became introduced to the needs of a racially diverse population including Asian/Pacific Americans.


During the past 12 years as a City Council member, I have been further educated about Seattle's Asian and Pacific communities with the help of my former assistant, Alan Kurimura. I became involved in a number of projects including securing City support for the Chinese Information and Referral Service. I believe the knowledge I have gained and the support I demonstrated for the Asian/Pacific communities equips me well for responding to issues relating to these communities.


Jane Noland (Position 2): I am a lawyer with a Master's degree in public law and government. I have practiced law privately and have been legal counsel and a staff member for the King County Council.


In addition to legal experience, I have served in the Peace Corps, worked as a community organizer and administrator in a day care center in East Harlem, New York, and I have traveled and worked in other parts of the world, including Western Europe (tour leader), Iran (Peace Corps Volunteer), India (volunteer in a school in south India), Korea and Japan (fishing litigation), Southeast Asia (visited refugee camps in Thailand), and Micronesia (audit for legal services corporation). I have spent more than four years of my adult life living in other cultures.


I recognize that people have different ways of doing things and I respect and value cultural diversity. This awareness will, I believe, enable me to act more effectively in practical ways as a City Councilperson.


In the area of human services policy, for example, I will be able to recognize the circumstances in which it is necessary and appropriate that City programs address differing nutritional, medical and mental health needs of differing communities in the City.


I also understand that because of past discrimination, the vast talents of the Asian Pacific American communities have been seriously underutilized. I am committed to seeing that the City does its part to change that.


Tutti Carter Orange (Position 2): I was born and raised in Seattle 35 years ago in the predominantly Asian and Black community of Seattle. I attended Leschi Elementary, Washington Jr. High School, and graduated from Garfield High School and the University of Washington.


My family, friends, teachers, classmates, neighbors, and neighborhood store merchants have all been members of this very ethnic community that I grew up in. Because of this close community between the Asian and Black community, we grew up understanding each other's family ties, cultures, social needs, friends, etc.


But we shared more than neighborhoods, culture, friendships. We shared the pain of being racial minorities in the City of Seattle. We grew up together understanding what discrimination and oppression meant. Because of this pain, I and many others in this City, members of this Central Area community of Seattle, dedicated our lives to improving the quality of life for all oppressed peoples -- particularly those of the minority races.


For the past 10 years, I have been employed as a legislative assistant to the Seattle City Council. In my role as Chief Legislative Clerk and Full Council Staff Assistant, I have gained extensive experience in the past in budget analysis, legislative coordination, media affairs, community relations, administration of City Council meetings, public affairs, and in extensive governmental liaison work between the City Council and the Mayor, Metro, King County Council, State Legislature and other state, national and international offices.


I have also broadened my knowledge of local government by serving as the legislative department's EEO officer, safety coordinator and one in charge of the training of new staff. I work closely with the public, instructing on how to petition the City Council on any issue and assisting those who visit the Council with questions and problems.


Steve Zemke (Position 2): What my candidancy offers to the Asian Pacific American communities is a long term public record of leadership and effectiveness on many issues facing Seattle. I have worked with the Seattle City Council and the Mayor on many City issues over the last 10 years. These include working to keep electricity bills down, controlling WPPSS spending, increasing recycling opportunities, reducing solid waste, preserving low income housing, and opposing the convention center at the freeway site.


For the last four years, I have chaired Don't Bankrupt Washington -- the statewide ratepayers group that took on WPPSS to control their spending. I ran the successful Initiative 394 campaign which now gives Seattle ratepayers the right to vote before they are indebted for large power plants in the future.


I am a small businessman and homeowner in Lake City. I have a Master's Degree in Biology and spent several additional years doing graduate work at the University of Washington's College of Fisheries. I own Public Interest Consultants. My clients have included the League of Conservation Voters, Ruthe Ridder for Assessor, Washington Association for Children and Adults with Learning Disabilities and Washington Citizens for Recycling. My public record is one of strong leadership and getting results.


Roger D. Pence (Position 2): I have a 15 year record of public service, working to improve the quality of neighborhood life in Seattle. This experience has given me a great depth of knowledge of our city and its peoples.


I have a broad vision of our city, one that sees and recognizes the great diversity, differences and distinctions among our communities and their citizens.


I am committed to working for a society based on the principles of fairness, equity, justice and economic opportunity for all people without regard to their race, national origin, sex or any other irrelevant factor. I support affirmative action and equal employment programs to achieve these goals.


I have worked closely with Seattle's Asian Pacific community over the years, and have many friends in the International District. My wife is also a member of this community. My land use and planning expertise is of particular benefit to the community in that it will enable me to contribute much to the physical improvement of the International District, an area whose causes and interests I have supported from my leadership positions in other communities.


Babara Stenson (Position 2): As a native of central Seattle, a lifetime community volunteer, and a news reporter, producer and director for more than 20 years, I believe I have the most thorough understanding of our City and the challenges it faces.


I have not only attended school and worked with individuals of Asian descent, I also have hired and promoted Asian Americans in my capacity as a director of a major Seattle news organization.


As a reporter, I have successfully pressured major news organizations to bring to a mass audience issues of paramount concern to the Asian Pacific American communities, including producing Seattle's first TV special on the injustices of World War II relocation camps for Japanese Americans. I have consistently reported issues of concern to the Asian Pacific community, including the plight of refugees.


I have lived in primitive villages in central Asia. I have some understanding of the cultural trauma involved in the move from Southeast Asia to Seattle. I believe my experiences as a professional journalist and my four and a half years as a consumer advocate for the Washington State Attorney General's Office have prepared me to work effectively for the Asian Pacific American community in Seattle City government.


Phil Fraser (Position 3): I am a lifelong Seattle resident. My first home was an apartment in downtown Seattle. My family shopped at the Pike Place Market each week where much of the food we bought was grown and sold by Asian Pacific American farmers. As my family moved to different parts of the City, some of our neighbors and fellow students were from the Asian Pacific American communities. They taught me some of their customs and gave me an appreciation for the cultures which made them unique.


After graduating from the University of Washington in engineering, I worked at the Seattle Engineering Department where one of my bosses was Eilipino. He shared much of his cultural background with me. Currently, I am the Senior Engineer for the City of Tukwila, just south of Seattle. I have attended cultural exchanges sponsored by Tukwila with their sister city in Japan.


For two years I had the honor of serving under Ted Uomoto, the City's Public Works Director. Ted shared some of his experiences as a youth in the internment camps during World War II.


I believe my personal and professional experiences will equip me to respond knowlegeably and sensitively to issues in the Asian Pacific American communities.


Virginia Galle (Position 3): Four years on the City Council has increased my understanding of the Asian Pacific American communities. It has been a matter of priority for me to get out into the various communities -- and by so doing I have learned about issues directly from the people involved. I have attended many community activities, and have consistently supported International District social service agencies.


I look forward to continuing our warm relationship.


Peter Lukevich (Position 3): My willingness to listen and learn makes me able to equip myself to respond knowlegeably and sensitively to issues in the Asian Pacific American communities. In addition, I have spent years working on issues which affect communities of Seattle. The problems of our streets, police protection, solid waste disposal, etc. cross over community boundaries and thus impact your communities as well.


Recently, I spent 15 days in Japan and have become more aware of the need to continue to build our trade and economic relationship with that country. In addition, my college training includes business and communications which has provided me with the tools to build coalitions among groups and to get action on projects that I begin.


Michael Ahrens (Position 4): I have much experience relating to people of different races, having grown up in communities of mixed peoples. I have studied cross cultural relations, and for added measure, my wife grew up in Japan. I have also participated in international student clubs, and have had international students stay with me in my home.


Jeanette Williams (Position 4): Through the experience I have gained on the City Council, I have become familiar with the variety of issues facing the Asian Pacific American communities. I have come to know and appreciate the work done by the various community organizations such as the Asian Counseling and Referral Service, the Chinese Information and Service Center and the Polynesian Senior Center.


I have visited the organizations and have become acquainted with the people who make them successful. This knowledge and respect for the valuable work that is being accomplished is of great assistance when it is my responsibility to make decisions concerning the allocation of City resources to the many needs of the citizens of Seattle. Without the knowledge and background I have gained, informed responsive decisions could not be made.


The International District is the major business center for Asian Pacific Americans in Seattle. Are there appropriate ways the City can promote tourism as a strategy for economic development of the International District? Please describe.


Benson: One of the most appropriate ways to promote tourism for the District is to extend the Waterfront Streetcar into the International District. Metro is currently planning for such an extension which I am supporting. This extension will tie those who today visit the water-front into the rich, cultural diversity available in the ID. Furthermore, the Convention and Visitors Bureau, which receives support from the City, should further encourage tourism in the ID through its promotional efforts.


Noland: The City can promote tourism as a strategy for economic development of the International District; however, tourism should only be one of many strategies for economic development. I believe Seattle can become a gateway to the Pacific Rim. In order to make that a reality, the City will need substantial involvement by Asian Pacific Americans in terms of business ability, language and cultural knowledge.


The City should also promote tourism in the International District by working with people who live and/or work there to maintain the cultural flavors of the District and ensure that existing businesses catering to the tourism industry (restaurants, shops, banks, etc.) remain healthy and growing. This also means ensuring that the International District does not become a parking lot for downtown while the tunnel is being built, that it has a solid base of mixed-income housing, not just low income housing, and that it is not destroyed by the impact of I-90 construction.


Orange: Yes. The City can promote tourism through the use of written public information and by advertising. Brochures and similar documents can be used so that visitors can be made aware of various sites and activities. The City can also provide low interest loans to businesses that depend on the tourist trade in an effort to help them survive financially during difficult or seasonable low periods.


Also, the City can provide funds to support and/or assist supporting public improvement projects such as street improvements, the placement of business signs and other written material in foreign languages, artwork, and the extension of the Waterfront Trolley for additional waterfront enjoyment and more convenient access to other businesses.


Pence: There are at least two ways the City can promote tourism in the International District. First, by working with tourist-promoting agencies to increase the visibility of the ID in their promotional programs. Second, by working with Metro to extend the Waterfront Streetcar into the ID.


Increased tourism must be approached with some caution, however. While it can certainly lead to increased business for many retailers, it can also be overdone to the detriment of local businesses and residents. Excessive tourist activity can result in retail rent increases to the point where retailers cannot survive without trade. When this happens, businesses which cater primarily to local people -- the laundromats, shoe repair shops, small groceries -- start to disappear, to be replaced by more restaurants and gift shops.


There is at least some risk that this could happen in the ID if tourism succeeded too well, so I would hope the community approaches this particular economic development mechanism with some due caution.


Stenson: Tourism is important to the economic well being of all retail/commercial areas in Seattle. The first priority, however, is assurance our own community is well served. We need well trained, adequate police and fire protection, a revision of the current building and business permitting system to help new businesses start and existing businesses expand where appropriate. In short, the helping attitude from the City to make a healthy neighborhood will create an environment attractive to visitors who want to spend money.


Additionally, the City must help mitigate the adverse impacts of major events at the nearby Kingdome. Traffic, transit, and parking control must enable the International District to function when major events draw thousands to the Dome.


Obviously Seattle must increase its energies, public and private, in marketing our City and its International District to the travel industry. Cooperation with the State Department of Commerce and Economic Development will be an important part of that effort.


Zemke: Tourism is one way that the economic development of the International District can be assisted. Crucial to tourism promotion of the International District is the District's economic livelihood and vitality as a memorable place people would enjoy visiting and gladly tell others about as a place to visit.


Small businesses are crucial to the vitality of the International District. Small businesses need to be helped -- both new ones and existing ones -- to assure that a wide and diverse range of small shops, mom and pop stores, small restaurants and other concerns can make it financially. The District is currently zoned for small business. Technical assistance can be provided to help with start-up problems and costs, rehabilitation of existing buildings, and ongoing promotion.


In addition the City can assist in promoting tourism by making sure that the International District is promoted by traveling City officials and is one of the areas visited by officials coming to out city. Emphasis in the media and elsewhere needs to concentrate on the positive aspects of the International District, particularly its culture and the uniqueness of character that it offers to both local people and tourists. If local people use the District, they are more likely to show it to their out-of-town visitors.


Fraser: I believe an extension of the Waterfront Trolley to and through a portion of the International District would bring in more tourists to the International District. I believe this is a natural extension of the trolley service as it ties two of the City's focal points together, the Waterfront and the International District. By this extension, ridership will certainly increase, providing a stronger farebox revenue to the Trolley Program.


The continued use of Block Grant Funds to restore and preserve historic parts of the International District is needed.


Finally, my three-part employment growth program is aimed at more aggressively promoting Seattle as a site for increased international trade and tourism: 1) Revamp Department of Intergovernmental Relations into focused marketing function for Seattle's future employment growth/trade development; 2) Establish Tacoma/Everett co-sister cities to joint-venture marketing Pacific Rim countries; 3) Provide World Citizenship Week to cultivate Seattleites to cultures, how to treat foreign trading, and tourist guests.


Galle: Yes. Tourist visits to the International District should be promoted as an integral part of all City tourist promotion. The International District, with the Nippon Kan Theater, Wing Luke Museum and International Asian American Film Festival, should be featured along with the Pike Place Market, the Waterfront and Pioneer Square, for having unique and intriguing characteristics. The availability of Asian cultural services and products such as theaters, stores and restaurants should be highlighted. The exciting possibility of an East/West Trade Center should be promoted. Tours of Seattle including officials and other dignitaries should always be routed through the International District.


Lukevich: Yes! I am not convinced that we need to create an office of tourism at the City level, but rather we need representatives of the Mayor's office and the City Council to work with private industry and State representatives to develop a strategy for economic development in our International District. I would suggest that a member of the City Council should have accompanied Governor Gardner on his trip to Japan to promote Seattle, its International District, positive business climate, and the tourism industry of Seattle. It is imperative that the City Council look at every opportunity to promote Seattle and its fine communities. Perhaps another way to increase importance of a tourism strategy would be a focus on the Council in the form of a subcommittee of another established Council committee that looks at our tourism possibilities across the board.


Ahrens: Cultural differences have always been a great attractor of people, such as Chinatown and Japanese Village, etc., in Southern California. I'm sure the same kinds of things could be done in Seattle, so I'd say that there would probably be some ways the City could cooperate with Asian American business owners in making the Asian business district more of a cultural attraction. But it must be kept in mind that under our form of government, which protects freedom and the free enterprise system, it's the responsibility of private business owners to make their own businesses a success. It is not proper for City government to be aiding one business district over another, but there are some things the City could do to make the District more attractive, such as closing off and remodeling streets, while the private businesses could possibly cooperate together in building an Asian cultural mall. But the cost of construction would have to be borne by the Asian businesses who would be benefiting by such a venture. Also, this business district could be listed on travel brochures and tourist itineraries. I would have to study further to find other possible, appropriate ways.


Williams: Successful promotion of tourism to Seattle requires a cooperative effort. The public and private sectors must support each other's efforts. Because of its limited resources, the City must work with other government agencies to ensure the most effective use of the very limited funds available to promote tourism.


Tourism can bring economic benefits to a community such as the International District. It would be a mistake, however, for Seattle to promote tourism to the International District or any other area of the City without providing the opportunity for full participation by businesses and residents in the planning efforts. Such cooperative planning would help to reduce the adverse effects which can occur in a community that becomes a tourist attraction.


Through a careful, cooperative planning effort, I believe that it will be possible to maintain the stability and integrity of the International District while achieving the advantages or higher employment for the residents and more business for the merchants in the District.


Do you see a relationship between the increasing number of ""street people"" in the International District and the loss of low income housing in downtown? How do you propose to deal with the problem?


Benson: Yes, I do believe there is a connection. I propose to deal with the problem through the following: support for emergency, shelter; zoning code bonus options for downtown housing; housing preservation and minimum maintenance ordinances; housing bond issues; economic development to create jobs for the homeless; continuing survival services for the homeless, such as food banks and medical care; and enforcement of the City's menacing prohibitions.


Noland: One of my first tasks will be to work with my Council colleagues to develop a comprehensive human services policy for the City. City government should ensure a basic level of shelter, food, and medical care for those in emergency situations. We must also address the needs of families and children. Money invested early to assist children and families is money saved later. That means child care, jobs for teenagers, help for troubled youth, and programs to help integrate foreign families into our community. We must also continue and enhance the City's excellent program to help seniors remain independent.


As the downtown develops, there will be a natural movement of street people to other areas of the City. This will impact the International District since it abuts downtown. This problem should be dealt with by increasing the amount of emergency shelter available downtown, as well as other parts of the City.


I support a bond issue for additional scattered site low income housing. I will also support such creative efforts to find other funding for low income housing as using the interest on escrow accounts (if the legislature will enact it), and earmarking particular funds, like part of the annual property tax adjustment, which will also require action by the state legislature. I also support Community Redevelopment Financing as another tool to encourage private low income housing.


Orange: Yes, I do see a relationship between the two. There has been a loss of several hundred unsubsidized low income units all of which occurred in areas other than in the International District. This loss of low income units has caused the homeless people to migrate to areas where low income single rate occupancy units still exist. The International District is one of these areas. A large percentage of alcoholic people live in these units. More and more, street people are coming to live in this area because of the low cost of housing and because they feel more comfortable being around people with similar housing, financial, and social needs. Many street people will befriend another street person by offering to share housing.


Regardless, we cannot discriminate against these people because they are poor, alcoholic, or because of our need to ""clean up downtown."" By shifting the view of large numbers of street people from downtown to the International District, we accomplish nothing. The City should provide research for other funding sources to provide more single rate occupancy units, emergency shelters, and sleep centers and continue to develop other sources of funding and assistance from the private sector.


Pence: Yes, of course there is a direct relationship between the loss of low income housing downtown and the increased number of street people in the ID and elsewhere in Seattle. Solving downtown housing shortages for low and moderate income people is a very complex subject, requiring a number of different strategies to be worked together. We cannot afford to reject any reasonable attempt. I have fully supported the Housing Preservation Ordinance and the Housing Maintenance Ordinance as reasonable and practical efforts to require developers to assume some responsibility for the housing they destroy in the development process. My main opponent, however, is a downtown lawyer named Jane Noland who opposed these important measures. She has been endorsed and financially supported by downtown business and development interests. Other measures to protect and enhance low and moderate income housing include building more housing via a bond issue.


Stenson: Yes. The problem of Seattle's homeless can be viewed as three parts -- the mentally ill, the ""predators,"" and those in financial/housing crises. The City must help -- with physical space and funds, if possible -- the private, nonprofit organizations to help the truly needy. It must pressure the State to provide adequate community based mental health treatment, which is the State's responsibility, and it must deploy its newly recruited beat patrol officers in high risk areas to deter the criminal population on our streets.


More appropriate housing sites than the International District must be found for those in need of shelter. I believe mental health/halfway house/crisis services must be placed equitably throughout our City, not concentrated in one area.


We need a regional (at least countywide) siting policy for special needs facilities. I will work cooperatively with the State, the County, the suburban cities, and our neighborhoods to develop such a plan.


Zemke: The loss of low income housing downtown has been a contributing factor to the increased number of street people in the International District and downtown in general. I support both the Housing Preservation Ordinance and the Housing Maintenance Ordinance as necessary steps in trying to preserve and maintain low income housing units in the downtown area. It will be vital that the Seattle City Council keep a close watch on the effectiveness of both of these ordinances to ensure that they are accomplishing their objective.


In addition we need to adequately fund the City's Survival Services Programs which provide emergency housing, food, and medical care. These funds are threatened by the loss of Federal Revenue Sharing dollars -- currently $1 million per year. This money will be gone in 1987. We need to come up with new revenues to continue to provide these services while seeking out long-range solutions that address such factors as alcoholism and mental health problems. The small health clinics, emergency shelters, and food banks are only temporary solutions and do not address the long-term problems. One important long-term solution includes stemming the continued loss of low income housing units in the downtown area.


Fraser: There is a direct relationship to the increasing number of ""street people"" in the International District and the loss of low income housing in downtown. I want Seattle to be known as a place where every citizen is considered an important element of our human community. Seattle must not become known as a place where there is ""no room at the inn."" And government must be a reliable last resort to provide adequate housing, food and health care for all its citizens.


First, I would encourage the use of the $5,000,000 excess funds from the Senior Housing Bond be used to build emergency housing in the Central Business District core area for both transient and chronic homeless populations.


Second, I would promote a comprehensive housing plan to be developed by the City with its goal to wipe out temporary emergency and permanent low income housing deficiencies in this City by 1991.


Third, I will work to have this program fully funded through passage of additional bonds, etc., as is appropriate. The City cannot rely solely on the existing Anti-Abandonment/Anti-Demolition Ordinances to secure needed housing for our downtown poor.


Galle: There is clearly a cross relationship between the destruction of low income housing in downtown Seattle and the increasing number of street people. It should be emphasized that there are other causes as well.


Seattle should continue to push for net additions of low income housing units in the core business area. The best way to do this is conditioning construction of additional low income units on the granting of building permits for large scale projects in the downtown area. The City should be flexible in granting trade-offs in the form of variances which site the low income units in the neighborhoods with the greatest needs. The City should not be flexible in relaxing the standard of requiring net additional low income units.


Construction of publicly funded units should receive high priority consideration in future budget allocations. The realities of budget constraints and high construction costs reduce the potential of publicly funded alternatives, however.


Lukevich: I am sure there is a relationship between the increased numbers of street people and the loss of low income housing in downtown; however, it is not the only factor which needs to be considered.


In addition, we need to look at state and county programs which have allowed for less individuals to be provided emergency service care and housing. Furthermore, with increased overcrowding of some of our institutions the care for some persons can no longer be provided.


As a temporary measure, the City should look closely at providing temporary housing in closed Seattle School District school buildings. With some modification and update, we would be able to provide adequate housing and living conditions for our street people. This use of quasi government properties would be better than boarding them up and inviting vandalism, etc. It is important that the community near the schools be informed of the decision and given the opportunity to provide input to minimize impacts on their communities.


We must also work harder at attracting private donations and support to increase our emergency services budget so as to be able to continue to provide some level of care.


Ahrens: No. The increase in street people in the central city areas are a result of our nation's serious economic hard times that are worsening every day, and quite rapidly. Cities and counties across our nation are seeing people losing jobs and going bankrupt. The solution to this problem is a national one, and there is not much a City Councilman can do, but subsidized housing for the poor is only attracting more people to central Seattle, and isn't helping the situation at all.


Of course, some of the street people need alcohol and drug therapy. But many are driven to drugs and alcohol because of economic hard times. One possibility is that the City could offer temporary housing in exchange for part-time community service while they're looking for regular work.


But again, this won't help much since the problem of our economy is federal. There is definitely a housing shortage, and when there is a shortage of housing, prices go up. Contractors have been eager to build in Seattle, but the Council has been slow in granting permits, and has deliberately hindered development. I will change this.


Williams: Yes, I believe that there is a relationship between the number of ""street people"" and the loss of low income housing downtown. However, the increased number of street people is the result not only of the loss of low income housing. It is also the result of the loss of other services such as mental health and shelter services because of the cutbacks in state and federal budgets.


I believe that the City should deal with this problem through an open public process in which the priority and level of funding for services to street people is established. The City should also address the problem by working with other cities facing similar problems, to obtain increased assistance from the federal and state governments.


SEATTLE SCHOOL BOARD


How does your personal and professional experience equip you to respond knowledgeably and sensitively to the issues in the Asian Pacific American communities?


Elizabeth Wales (District 4): I care about people and fairness in our society. Everything I have done to date has had a strong element of service in it. I think I have responded to people's needs wherever and whenever I was in a position to do something about those needs.


My children both attend Seattle public schools. I positively value the rich multicultural environment of the schools they attend. As a School Board member, I intend to promote our Seattle School District's multicultural environment, while at the same time I will be a strong and out-spoken advocate for the individual needs of all children.


The Asian Pacific American communities and particularly the children in these communities have special needs that the Seattle School District must recognize and respond to. I think that in headlining or emphasizing adequate and stable funding for the needs of urban children, I am talking about what is most important for the Asian Pacific American children.


We cannot respond if we lack public funding. I am fighting for that funding. I am running for the Seattle School Board because I hope to see Seattle meet the needs of its children, but this state and this wonderful city are going to have to pay to meet those needs. Efficiency in management will help, but it will only buy us a little more time.


Monica Wooton (District 4): I am committed to multicultural education in Seattle Public Schools. I have worked closely with the Effective Schools Project, am very concerned with data from that project which indicates an erosion in standard test scores among Asian students between elementary and secondary schools, and want to follow up on it. Members of my campaign steering committee have worked directly in the School District's bilingual education program, and are also representative of Asian Pacific American teachers in our schools.


As a School Board member, I would continue to call upon their expertise and that of others, as well as to listen and sensitively respond to the views and concerns of all the people our School District serves, as I have always done during my seven years of volunteer service to Seattle Schools. I have direct, verifiable experience in the District's gifted, regular classroom, and special education programs. I've worked on reducing student suspensions in our schools, and to assure that we are striving to meet the needs of each student in our District.


I believe that my record of service to Seattle Public Schools demonstrates my personal sensitivity and capability to deal with issues in the Asian Pacific American community.


Gwendolyn Ford (District 5): The many challenges I faced during the Civil Rights Movement in the 60s and the mutual benefit from affirmative action advances have made me aware of the collective power the unity of progressive peoples of color can generate.


The Asian community in the American world community is part of what many term the Third World. However, I would prefer to call it the developing world in which I place myself in the same category, being of African heritage.


The economic, social and political problems have grown out of a legacy of colonialism and the lack of allocation of resources on the part of the colonialist to establish an infra-structure to serve the needs of the colonized people of the world.


As people of color and exploited people on whose backs capitalistic and industrial change developed, the same practice of -- lack of economic development, political opportunity in America and political independence abroad has no meaning without economic development based on strong cultural and spiritual ties.


Michael R. Preston (District 5): My personal experience has included over 30 years of living, working and attending school in the diverse communities of Seattle's Central Area. This lifetime exposure has given me sensitivity to the issues of all people. I have a Bachelor of Arts, and Master's Degree in Educational Administration from Western Washington University. My employment and volunteer experiences have been predominately in the areas of youth programs and educational opportunities.


I have been a constant and sometimes lone advocate for full and comprehensive funding for programs for bilingual students as witnessed in my proposal presented at the July 24th School Board meeting to restore full funding to these programs. I will continue to support and strengthen programs that help the District to respond to the important issues in the Asian/Pacific American communities.


Because of federal cutbacks, the bilingual education program has been subjected to reductions in the level of support by the School District. How would you ensure adequate and stable funding for the program?


Wales: I will strongly advocate as a Seattle School Board member that the Seattle School District immediately set in place a full-time lobbyist in Olympia to push for the needs of Seattle's children. I will also work independently to form alliances with other school districts in this state and with other concerned and sympathetic organizations to form strong coalitions backing the needs of education in this state, especially the needs of urban children.


More specifically, the Seattle School District's responsibility for bilingual education is to meet statutory requirements. Determining and fixing these statutory requirements is a legislative matter: ideally, the statutory requirements address the real needs of Seattle's, and all of Washington's, immigrant population.


I am a supporter and defender of bilingual education. I am also an advocate for having the State live up to its statutory funding requirements. Until Seattle District receives adequate funding from the State for bilingual education, the Basic Education offering in the Seattle District will be significantly diminished in order to pay for this important urban need, bilingual education.


Wooton: The Seattle School District has a great responsibility for the inclusion and education of bilingual children within its system. We must accept the challenge of enabling children to become sufficiently proficient in English, without compromising their cultural heritage. We must be conscientious in providing bilingual children with adequate language and literacy skills so that they may become contributing members of our society, which is built on the principles of multicultural inclusion and appreciation.


I would pursue adequate and stable funding for our bilingual education programs through several means. I would scrutinize our School District's budget, priorities, and expenditures to make sure that we're using the resources we already have as efficiently as possible. We should review and reprioritize, if necessary, option program funding in light of basic education funding needs, such as bilingual education.


The District should be actively seeking restoration of bilingual education funding through our federal government representatives. And on the state level, the District should work with the legislature to determine the real costs of meeting education needs in an urban district such as Seattle, including bilingual education, and provide an adequate base of state support.


Ford: America, in spite of the majority American viewpoint, has always been a multicultural, multilingual nation. As an elected offical, I would lobby city, state and national officials to recognize their responsibility to bilingual programs and the need to broaden all Americans' language base.


Based on my experience in the areas of fundraising and grant writing, I would also write to private foundations to solicit funds for the bilingual education program.


Preston: I would ensure adequate and stable funding for the Seattle School District's bilingual education programs through my efforts as a School Board Director by giving this funding a high priority in the District's budget process. I would also encourage the School District staff to aggressively pursue all potential funding available from the federal government. I would continue to work for adequate state funding that would be responsive to the diverse needs of Seattle's student population.


Given the diversity of Seattle's student population, should the School District provide continuing mandatory multicultural, in-service training to its teachers? What priority will you give to allocating resources for this training?


Wales: This is a first priority item on my agenda. Teachers must understand the different cultures represented in their classrooms if they are to appropriately respond to the needs of their students. Teacher training costs in a rich multicultural environment such as Seattle's must necessarily be high. Here is another cost that makes Seattle School District's job much more expensive than any other district in this state: Seattle has more special needs to respond to and meet than any other district.


Again, I am running for this position because I believe that in order to respond to these needs we must address difficult state funding questions. I hope for and would deeply appreciate and honor backing from the Asian Pacific American community because I believe I am aware of and working to meet the needs of this community, most especially the children in this community.


Wooton: I believe that the Seattle School District is presently providing less than adequate multicultural, in-service training to its teachers and staff. Helping our teachers to do the best job possible and providing in-service training is second only to directly assisting children by meeting classroom needs in my list of priorities for resource allocation.


The Seattle School District needs to make a greater commitment to in-service training through both effort and resources. Quality staff training is a requisite for improved instruction in our schools.


Training must be directed toward increasing instructional quality, and mandatory multicultural training is a vital component of this effort. Principals, teachers, and administrative and support staff should all be adequately trained so that our District's efforts -- from the school office to the classroom to administrative offices -- can be as effective as possible in meeting the needs of all our children. We cannot expect or pretend to be educating our diverse student population if our staff is not sensitive to, and equipped to deal with, that diversity.


We must not continue using in-service training, including multicultural training, as a bargaining chip in negotiations between the District and its staff. We must give a higher priority to allocating resources to multicultural training than we have in the past.


Ford: Without mandatory multicultural inservice training for teachers, there cannot be a true multicultural learning experience. Therefore, allocating resources for this training to the teachers is my highest priority.


As a Board member, I would also work with the legislators in an attempt to have more funds allocated to the University of Washington and other teacher training colleges to provide more funds for teachers to be prepared through knowledge of various cultures and lifestyles as presented in the classroom. This training should also prepare teachers with the knowledge to apply the various methodology in the classroom when it is more suited to another culture.


Preston: Mandatory multi-culture inservice training to teachers needs to be improved and strengthened so that it has a truly sensitizing effort on the participants. Placement and hiring of ethnically representative staff is crucial to meet this need since our District's ethnic minority students will soon be the majority of the children enrolled in the system. Allocating resources to help our teachers better serve our students has and always will be a high priority for me.


PORT OF SEATTLE COMMISSION


How would you involve Asian Pacific Americans in the Port's development of international commerce?


Jack Block (Position 1): I believe Asian Pacific Americans are one of the most valuable resources available to the Port of Seattle and our community. Their track record at the Port is exemplary. The Port, at my urging, is targeting jobs and setting up on-the-job internships for Asian students currently enrolled at Seattle Community College's central campus and other schools and organizations.


Lloyd Robinson (Position 1): There should be several substantial programs to involve this vital part of our community in the Port's efforts:


Key staff members working in international commerce should be Asian Americans. This would lend a great deal to the Port's credibility in development.


The Port can play a key role in encompassing private industry to develop internship programs with industry in each Pacific Rim trading country.


Encourage an active Asian American community in Seattle and promote its active involvement in international commerce issues.


Help get more visibility for consulate offices here that now or in the future will exist.


Pat Davis (Position 4): Asian Americans are a key resource. Those with appropriate skills should be involved more fully in marketing, tenant/client relations, and staff work directly involving Asian countries.


If an intern program is developed, it should not only include representatives from Pacific Rim trading countries studying here, but also our own students as interns at Asian ports. I will do all I can to focus Port efforts on incorporating more Asians into Port activities.


Henry Aronson (Position 5): I involved Asian Pacific Americans in Port of Seattle activities within the first week of my appointment by hosting functions attended by representatives of the local Japanese, Chinese, Korean and Filipino communities. In short, I requested their advice on how to draw upon the local Asian Pacific community to expand Port contacts and business in the Pacific Rim. I am pleased to report that these meetings have given rise to an expanded base of contacts which are being increasingly drawn upon by Port staff as a first step towards the creation of a Port Asian Pacific Advisory Council.


The local Asian Pacific community whose numbers represent virtually every Pacific Rim culture and dialect has a wealth of contacts and experience in the Pacific Rim -- the area upon which the trading future of this community will be based. These contacts have been virtually untapped by the Port. The Port has a unique and historic opportunity to combine this vast Asian Pacific community with traditional Port business contacts working towards the end of developing a far more efficient and extensive trade network.


John Jovanovich (Position 5): I would like to see the Port hire Asian Pacific Americans who are proficient in one or more Pacific Rim languages and have had training in business and marketing.


Working closely with federal, state and local governments, these people would work to make contacts between interested buyers and sellers in the United States and interested buyers and sellers in the Pacific Rim countries.


In some case where language is a barrier, they could also assist foreign buyers and sellers with their initial personal contact with their American counterparts.


Describe your vision of how the Port can develop trade with the Pacific Rim.


Block: I was one of the motivators to bring planners, engineers, and other staff members from Pacific Rim ports to Seattle for work-study sessions with technical experts of the Port of Seattle. This pioneering work is paying dividends to the taxpayers of King County with each new contract that is signed by those we helped train. Last year, the Port expanded its marketing staff to include representation in the Asian developing countries. I intend to expand the Port's sponsorship of internships for the individuals recruited from the Pacific Rim. This will allow our local Asian student interns to work with their countrparts from overseas.


Robinson: The key to trade development is to develop and maintain solid relationships. This can be done more completely by utilizing Asian American contacts and by doing all possible to bridge cultural differences. We as a community, and the Port as a key element in that community, must be on the leading edge of the ""world economic"" order and all it holds for a true international economic base for the Seattle region.


It is people and leadership that will make the difference as trading partners.


Davis: The Port can develop trade by more intensive marketing efforts, concentration on better retention of tenants and customers, taking steps toward regional port cooperation, providing the best possible facilities and state-of-the-art services to facilitate the flow of goods, and developing a reputation for stability and cohesiveness. I also believe that the time has come for the Port to search for new ways to generate jobs and revenues, such as the new tourism program does.


Aronson: Seattle, two days closer by ship to the Pacific Rim than our major competitior, the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, has an unparalleled opportunity to become the U.S. gateway to the Pacific Rim. Potential programs and ideas include:


-- Identification of new markets. The Port's major sources of business today include Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore. In addition, considerable development is taking place in the People's Republic of China. Looking ahead, it is clear the south Asian countries -- the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Burma, Sri Lanka, Vietnam and India -- will be the source of increasing trade as their internal political problems sort out and they increase their ability to extract and convert their vast store of resources. These markets ought to be cultivated at this time in anticipation of their emergence as a substantial trading partner.


-- Port Fellows. The Port ought to sponsor, say, five of the best and brightest students from each of the countries targeted for business expansion as Port Fellows. In ten years, the Port would then have an extensive network of emerging business, political and governmental leaders to draw upon in expanding into their home markets.


In sum, there is no limit to our potential for expansion. With planning, ingenuity and boldness, the Port can realistically aspire to serve as the gateway to the Pacific Rim for the coming century just as New York City served as the gateway to Europe during the past century.


Jovanovich: The Port should store business leads in a data bank. This information would be available to both foreign and United States businessmen interested in making trade contacts. Not only would the information be available to businessmen on request, the people working with the information at the Port would constantly work to try to initiate contacts between interested parties on both sides.


How would you ensure that the Port maintains accountability to the public?


Block: When I was re-elected in 1979, I told my fellow Commissioners that we had to open up the Port's decision making process to the public. As a result, we now have public work-study sessions between community representatives and the Port staff. I put special effort into establishing the first full-time staffed office for the Port Commission so the public may contact me or any other Commissioner directly without having to go through the Port's bureaucracy. I am proud of my 12 year record and I want to continue serving our community.


Robinson: The only way is to enunciate clear long-range and short-range goals dealing with trade, facility development, finance, people and personnel practices, and Port policies. Then report at least once a year against the goals, the accomplishments.


I believe the Port has not done enough to keep the public informed of this, nor has it adequately sought public input in the past. It would be a top priority of mine to institute these practices.


Davis: Accountability comes through a Commission which is vigilant in its over-sight of policy implementation. Commissioners must be proactive, and have compelling justification in terms of return to the taxpayers, for expenditures, projects and developments. An accountable Port will also be sensitive to impacts of decisions on local communities and private businesses. Open meetings, predictable processes, timely notification and access by the public to information are also clearly a part of accountability.


Aronson: By being fully briefed, as Commissioner, on Port issues and remaining accessible to the public; opening of the budget process; increased public bearings at times and places convenient to citizens directly affected by Port plans; increasing contacts with the media; and generally using every conceivable opportunity to involve the public in the affairs of the Port.


Jovanovich: I would encourage the public to attend Port meetings both at the Port facility and at community meetings. This must be done by letting them know they are welcome and that Port officials are interested in what they think and have to say.


The press and other media should also be encouraged to follow Port matters closely and report their findings to the public.


People must be more aware of how their money is being spent. I feel it is the Port's duty to see that this information is given out to the media in clear and understandable reports.

The Reagan administration's plan to issue a new executive order on affirmative action, which would eliminate goals and timetables, has been met with opposition from the Organization of Chinese Americans (OCA). Dr. S. Andrew Chen, president of OCA, said this order would reverse years of civil rights struggles and further threaten the status of minorities and women in the labor force.


Civil rights experts believe the absence of statistical information from goals and timetables would make it impossible to fight employment discrimination since it is now recognized as the primary court evidence to prove discrimination.


This proposed executive order will affect the hiring and promotion of 23 million Americans in 73,000 private businesses, including universities and agencies under contract to the federal government.


In Boston, Chinese American Long Guang Huang was found not guilty of charges of soliciting a prostitute and assaulting a police officer in the case that brought protests from the Asian American community and widespread press coverage from the local news media. The acquittal came on the fourth day of a nonjury trial. Asian Americans in Boston have called the verdict a major victory.


In the May 1 incident, police detective Francis G. Kelly contended that Huang solicited a prostitute, then resisted arrest and assaulted the officer. At least nine witnesses told a different story. They said that Kelly grabbed Huang and beat him without provocation or resistance from Huang.


The Committee to Support Long Guang Huang, which provided legal, financial and moral support, plans to stay together for the time being and monitor the police misconduct hearing of Kelly.


Issei, Nisei, Kibei and Japanese scholars and journalists met last weekend for the international Japanese immigrant press symposium in Los Angeles' Little Tokyo. The symposium, ""Coming of Age in the Thirties: the Nisei and the Japanese Immigrant Press,"" included an impressive roster of Nisei writers and editors, who gave first-hand accounts of what was being reported about the Japanese community by the immigrant press.


Keynote speaker was University of California regent Yori Wada.


Two years after the assassination of Filipino opposition leader Benigno ""Ninoy"" Aquino, the Philippine Supreme Court ruled that evidence gathered by a fact-finding board against Armed Forces Chief of Staff General Fabian Ver was inadmissible, reports East/West. Ver is the most famous of the defendants accused in the Aquino murder.


The independent fact-finding board was assembled after public skepticism forced President Ferdinand Marcos to abandon the Fernando Commission that was scheduled to investigate the murder.


The military had claimed that a lone gunman was responsible for the murder, but after a year-long investigation, the fact-finding board charged the military with conspiracy and accused Ver with being involved.


Without the evidence from the board, it is likely that Ver's trial will be dismissed.


About 150 Japanese Peruvians, interned in Crystal City, Texas camps during World War II, met in Los Angeles last month for a reunion dinner, reports the Pacific Citizen.


Because of pre-war anti-Japanese sentiments, Japanese Peruvians were placed in detention camps in the U.S. with the cooperation of the government of Peru. After the war, Peru did not want the deportees back and treated them as ""illegal aliens.""


Although the Japanese Peruvians are not included on the redress bills now before Congress, Elsa Kudo urged fellow former internees at the reunion to support the ""cause of reparations."" The redress bills excluded Peruvians because they were not placed in camps as a result of Executive Order 9066.


Kudo stated that ""if and when redress passes, the precedent will have been set for compensation for being detained because of race. Perhaps on that level something could be done for those who were in Crystal City.""

Lee Ya-Ping, who has been accused of publishing communist propaganda in the International Daily News, a Chinese language newspaper in Los Angeles, was released in Taipei, pending arraignment.


Lee, a Taiwanese citizen with immigrant status in the U.S., was arrested on Setember 17 for advocating the reunification of China and Taiwan, and for publishing the entire text of a 1982 interview with the Chinese ambassador to the U.S.


The U.S. State Department and leaders of both houses of the U.S. Congress have demanded Lee's unconditional release. Representative Stephen Solarz (D-N.Y.), chair of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Asian and Pacific Affairs, called Lee's arrest ""an act of profound disrespect for the people and laws of the U.S. that calls into serious question the eligibility of Taiwan for future arms sales from our country.""


Vietnamese fishermen are threatening to arm themselves after an unidentified commercial fishing boat fired on three Vietnamese setting a gill net off Bolinas Bay in California, the Hokubei Mainichi reported. None of the victims were injured.


Chieu Pham, president of the Vietnamese Fishermen. Association of America, based in Oakland, said the fishermen are capable of defending themselves if necessary. ""We don't want to see that happen,"" Pham said. ""We want to work with the American fishermen before lives are involved and it is too late.""


Other Vietnamese have been the target of racial taunts. A Coast Guard spokesman stated that they are investigating if the attack was racially motivated, hoping to avoid a violent confrontation like the one that erupted between white fishermen and Vietnamese in the Gulf of Mexico during the late 1970s.


The Vietnamese have been criticized by the American fishing industry for using gill nets, which also trap migratory birds, sea mammals and protected species of fish.


Educators and minority groups have strongly objected to the Reagan administration's plan to deregulate federal bilingual education programs, giving local school districts more control over their programs.


In a speech delivered on September 26, Education Secretary William Bennett said that after $1.7 billion of federal funding for bilingual education, ""we have no evidence that the children whom we sought to help have benefitted.""


Bilingual education supporters fear deregulation will give schools an excuse to drop their bilingual programs. They accuse the Reagan administration of trying to completely eliminate these programs.


On September 23, California Governor George Deukmejian signed into law a senate bill which appropriates $750,000 in state funds to establish the Japanese American National Museum in Los Angeles.


The funds will be made available when Los Angeles raises at least $1 million in matching funds. To help meet this goal, the museum committee is planning an inaugural fund-raising dinner on October 18 at the Bonaventure Hotel.


Hiroshi ""Hershey"" Miyamura, the only living Japanese American Congressional Medal of Honor awardee, will be honored at the dinner. A documentary film on Miyamura will also be shown.


Janice Mirikitani will be one of six prominent Bay Area women writers honored at the ""Women of Words"" luncheon in San Francisco on October 17. Mirikitani is program director at Glide Memorial Church in San Francisco and editor of several Asian American poetry anthologies. A volume of her poetry, ""Awake in the River,"" is in its second printing.


Other ""Women of Words"" honorees are Alice Adams, Alice Walker, Judy Grahn, Tille Olsen, and the late Josephine Miles.


The Women's Foundation, sponsor of this program, funds non-profit organizations that serve low-income girls and women in Northern California.

The recent visit of Senator Paul Laxalt, one of President Reagan's closest friends, to the Philippines ""to discuss the worsening military, political and economic situation there"" did not surprise many political observers who have closely watched the Philippines.


In sending Laxalt to Manila, President Reagan finally recognized the biggest single problem plaguing the United States: the continued advance of the national democratic movement in the face of continued political and economic deterioration.


It is logical that the U.S., which masterminded establishment of the government of Ferdinand Marcos in 1972 to protect its economic and political interests from a growing nationalist movement, would again ""save"" the Philippines from that same nationalist movement, now more powerful than in 1972.


A top National Security Study directive, dated November 2, 1984, explained that the U.S. ""does not want to remove Marcos from power"" or ""destabilize"" the Philippine government.


""While President Marcos at this stage is part of the problem,"" the document continues, ""he is necessarily part of the solution. We need to be able to work with him and to try to influence him through well orchestrated policy incentives and disincentives to set the stage for peaceful and eventual transition to a successor government whenever that takes place.""


With the rapid decline of the Marcos government and the steady growth of the overall anti-dictatorship movement, U.S. policy appears to have congealed around three points: isolate and weaken the revolutionary forces; promote reforms and stabilize anti-Marcos, but pro-American traditional politicians; and break Marcos and his cronies of control over the economy and the government.


In an effort to isolate the revolutionary forces and curb the growth of the New People's Army, the U.S. this August approved $70 million in Philippine military aid. Along with military aid, U.S. military advisors are gradually being introduced into the Philippines, disguised as ""mobile training teams,"" in preparation for possible U.S. military intervention.


To pacify and gain the confidence of pro-American politicians, the U.S. has applied pressure on Marcos to call national elections. Through this scheme, the U.S. hopes to ensure peaceful competition between traditional politicians, from whose ranks the successor to Marcos will be chosen.


Economically, the U.S. has been gradually pressuring Marcos and his cronies to ease their firm grip on the economy and permit reforms which would stabilize the government's economic base.


Whether Marcos gives an inch to this ""normalization program"" remains to be seen. It would be unrealistic for Marcos, determined to stay in power, to institute any real sharing of economic or political power. In fact, he continues to tighten his grip on the government. To prepare for the coming elections, he has packed the Commission on Elections with his own men. He has appointed a known Marcos loyalist to head the Supreme Court. He continues to control the National Assembly. Some court decisions are ignored in the name of national security. There are signs of a whitewash in the Benigno Aquino murder trial.


Although Senator Laxalt's visit has been interpreted by many as a warning to Marcos, the paradox is that it is politically impossible for the U.S. to strip Marcos of his power as long as he continues to serve and protect American interests.


This raises the question: How serious is the growing armed insurgency and the surging legal mass movements in the Philippines?


Since the declaration of martial law in 1972, Filipinos have been launching bigger and more extensive mass struggles, both armed and unarmed.


On the armed front, the New People's Army has gained greater strength due to the increasing support of peasants, workers and other sectors. Its guerrilla forces, numbering 32,000, including part-time fighters, are now spread throughout the land in 59 guerrilla fronts in 73 provinces.


Since the Aquino assassination, protest actions -- strikes, rallies and demonstrations -- have intensified.


Protests by support groups in the U.S., Canada, Asia, Europe, Australia and New Zealand have also contributed to the international isolation of Marcos.


Indeed, Marcos is troubled on all fronts. It is against this intensifying struggle that the Laxalt visit, as far as the Reagan administration is concerned, was of utmost importance. But one question remains: Will Marcos listen?

The House Ways and Means Committee recently approved a bill to reform the federal tax system. The bill, containing the biggest overhaul since the tax was enacted in 1913, would shift a significant portion of the tax burden from individuals to corporations.


The committee's bill would reduce individual taxes by about $135 billion between 1986 and 1990, while increasing corporate taxes by the same amount.


Individual taxes, on the average, would be cut by 8.4 percent. About 6.3 million low-income families would be swept off the tax rolls, according to a Ways and Means Committee analysis. Big corporations like Boeing, which have paid little or no taxes, would begin to pay a greater share even though the highest corporate tax rate would drop from 46 to 36 percent.


The bill would reduce the present 14 tax brackets to four tax rates of 15, 25, 35 and 38 percent. Current rates range from 11 to 50 percent. Those with taxable incomes below $20,000 would get the biggest tax cut. Most of us would pay a rate of 15 or 25 percent, which would result, on the average, in a 7.2 percent tax cut.


The biggest tax increase for corporations would come as a result of the elimination of key provisions of the 1981 Economic Recovery Act, which allowed for investment tax credits and faster schedules for depreciation.


Committee Chairperson Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) said the bill was ""a victory of the public interest over the special interest"" and a ""vast improvement over present law.""


The National Chamber of Commerce is against, the bill, arguing that the present tax law should be left alone.


The bill now goes to the House, which is expected to vote on it before the end of the year. The Senate will not take up the issue until next year. However, observers say that if Present Reagan does not endorse the bill, any overhaul of the tax system will have to wait.


A good tax system should be fair, understandable, easy to administer and raise enough money. The current tax structure is none of these. Special interests, using what they refer to as ""incentives,"" have manipulated the tax system to promote homeownership, low-in-come housing, commercial development, business expansion, gas and oil exploration and hundreds of other things delared ""desirable"" goals for society. Businesses, rather than expanding through demand for their goods or services, rely on an incentive -- a tax break. Similarly, families write off the interest payment on their mortgages in order to purchase homes.


The end result is an absurd tax structure that no one understands, that promotes indebtedness and subsidizes the rich and mainstream America.


The bill passed by the House Ways and Means Committee is a big improvement over the current system. It shifts the tax burden more to those who can afford to pay. But it is not ""tax simplification,"" as the Reagan administration originally intended; it is just as complex as the current system. Another fault is that it is ""revenue neutral,"" meaning that the proposed tax system will raise about the same amount of revenue as the present system. It won't help cut the federal deficit.


Despite these shortcomings, the House Ways and Means Committee bill warrants passage because it is fairer than the present system. After all, the central question is one of fairness, not incentives.


It seems, however, that Congress is more concerned about the federal deficit than the tax bill. The deficit should be the top agenda item for the nation's economy. The heavy borrowing by the federal government keeps long-term interest rates high, which slows economic growth. But our present tax system is one cause of the huge deficit and just as much at fault for the high interest rates. It was only a few years ago that the President and Congress reduced our taxes by 25 percent, which resulted, of course, in a substantial reduction in federal revenues. The tax system promotes borrowing. Think about all those who were encouraged to take out loans to purchase homes so that they could write off taxes.


Indeed, tax reform is the other side of the federal deficit issue. Changing the tax structure can mean greater or less revenue.


One has to wonder why the Democrats have not fully embraced the tax reform issue, even though they desperately need an issue to rally around. It would seem that they would jump on a cause that would shift the tax burden more to big corporations. It would also seem that they would increase federal revenues to reduce the deficit by increasing taxes for the wealthy and big corporations. But, with few exception, they have demonstrated that they would rather complain about the deficit and cuts in domestic programs.


It is even more disappointing to find little interest among local Democrats to change this state's tax system. Governor Booth Gardner calls the system ""terrible,"" but won't ask for a change until the state uses its money efficiently.


Washington State's tax structure, heavily dependent upon the sales tax, is regressive. A recent report on the state's economy confirms that although personal income has risen, tax revenues have declined. The reason for this is that 95 percent of the growth in personal income comes from investment income, which is not taxable. State revenues are largely a function of consumer spending, which does not necessarily coincide with economic growth.


Perhaps our local Democrats will get enough courage to end our regressive and unstable tax system. Or perhaps fairness is too much to ask for.

Perhaps, it was inevitable. The National League of Cities (NLC), a body of local elected public officials, already had Black, Hispanic and women's caucuses for years. Last week at the NLC conference here in Seattle, Asian American officials established an Asian Pacific American Municipal Officials organization of the NLC.


""We're off to a good start,"" said Lloyd Hara Seattle City Treasurer, the group's emporary chair and one of the organizers. ""I feel pleased that the other leadership came up to us to offer their encouragement and assistance.""


Ruth Santana, of the NLC staff, was especially helpful in setting up the group, he said. The new group is modeled after the Hispanic caucus.


It was an opportune time to create an Asian Pacific group, Hara said, because the conference was held on the west coast. Fife Mayor Robert Mizukami, Seattle City Council member Dolores Sibonga and Hara sent letters and questionnaires to Asian elected municipal officials prior to the conference inviting them to a meeting here.


About 20 met and decided to create the Asian Pacific caucus the day before the NLC conference began. Among those attending were Oxnard Mayor Nao Takasugi and Los Angeles's first Asian Council member Michael Woo (see related story on page 3).


One of the group's first actions was to initiate NLC passage of a resolution on the World War II relocation and internment of civilians. A resolution against apartheid was also passed at the conference.


The newly-elected NLC president is Henry Cisneros, Mayor of San Antonio and the first Hispanic president of the national organization. Cisneros will lead the NLC at a time when the Reagan administration and Congress are certain to severely curtail federal aid to the cities.

Next month's snap presidential elections in the Philippines, hailed by some opposition groups as an excellent opportunity to gracefully oust Ferdinand Marcos, represent a last ditch effort by the U.S.-backed Marcos government to shore up its shaky foundation, severely weakened by the popular movement for change.


The Marcos government has reached such a level of bankruptcy that Marcos needs this exercise to claim a ""fresh and popular"" mandate from the people so he can consolidate his rule and, thereby, attain legitimacy for his policies of political and military repression. The election also provides the Reagan administration with an instrument for deflecting demands from some members of Congress who are calling for cutting off aid to Marcos.


Marcos's advantage over the elite opposition is so strong that, even before his surprise announcement of the snap elections, State Department officials warned Congress last October 30 not to be surprised if Marcos and his group win the election.


Despite Marcos's assurance that the elections will be fair and clean, many believe the snap elections offer no hope to the Filipino people. The present climate of political repression renders the elections meaningless.


A ""Common Statement of Demands,"" signed by prominent Filipino leaders, describes the snap elections as a distraction from the growing popular demands for radical government change. The statement said, ""We cannot allow this distraction to continue nor can we permit the dictatorship to again make a mockery of the people's sacred right to suffrage. At this critical juncture in our nation's history, the people's long and arduous struggle for freedom, justice and democracy cannot just be disregarded.""


The U.S. also wants elections for other reasons. It is common knowledge that the ruling elite in Philippine politics is divided. Of immediate concern to the U.S. is how to mend the split in military leadership so it can better counter the surging tide of the nationalist and democratic movement.


The U.S.-based Alliance of Philippine Concerns (APC), representing more than 35 organizations in the U.S. and Canada, explains: ""Reagan administration officials have not been shy about expressing their desires: a Marcos 'sensitized' to the strategic interests of the U.S. and a Marcos 'reformed' to accommodate the disenchanted elite. Marcos or no Marcos, however, the envisioned scenario of the U.S. is that of a Philippines dominated by the imperial powers and the landed elite, in an aristocracy that increasingly becomes more repressive as the people become more organized.""


The current economic and political crisis engulfing the Philippines is the making of the U.S. and the Marcos dictatorship. It is not caused by the Communists as Marcos wants the people of the world to believe. On the one hand, by blaming the Communists, Marcos hopes to break the link between some traditional oppositionists and the mass-based movement. On the other hand, the elite oppositionists' enthusiastic response to the snap elections provided Marcos and the Reagan administration the opportunity to divide Marcos's elite opponents from the progressive nationalist movement.


The proposed snap elections is yet another scheme of the Marcos government to arrest its further isolation and improve the government's ability to repress the people's movement. It is not intended to oust Marcos. It falls within the U.S. government's scheme to reunify and consolidate the ruling classes behind Marcos. Thus, its primary objective is to strengthen and intensify fascist rule in the Philippines.


As Marcos is confronted by the growing people's movement, the U.S. has taken a more direct role in stabilizing the situation. The U.S. is disciplining Marcos, while exploring deals with the elite oppositionists. Since there is no possible alternative yet to Marcos, the best thing to do is to push him and his elite opponents to a common front against the people's movement by sharing political and economic power with the elite opposition.

International District social and health service agencies will try to maintain current levels of service to the community despite the City's announcement that the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program, a critical source of funds, will be cut 16.2 percent.


Mayor Charles Royer announced last week that the Reagan administration has deferred $500 million in CDBG funds already appropriated by Congress, in addition to withholding other funds in anticipation of cuts under the new balanced budget law.


The latest cuts mean that Seattle's 1986 CDBG funds will be over $2 million less than the City anticipated and 30 percent less than the 1985 funding level, Royer said.


Unless Congress reverses the President's decision, Royer said, the City will have to reduce funding for 125 programs which serve low-income people, including health clinics, shelters for the homeless, elderly programs, housing and other community improvement programs.


To deal with the latest federal cuts, Royer and City Council President Sam Smith agreed to institute a 16.2 percent across-the-board cut for all programs funded under the CDBG program.


Rona Zevin, Block Grant administrator for the City, conceded that the cut is ""harsh,"" adding, ""This is an interim measure. We can't allow agencies to spend money we don't have. But we're going to fight the cuts.""


If Congress does not act to overturn the reductions, the city will have to look at developing ""a process for determining the cuts,"" probably in March or April, Zevin said.


The cuts will squeeze all major social and health service agencies in the International District, which rely heavily on federal funds to sustain their operations.


ID agency directors huddled last Friday at the International District Community Health Center (IDCHC) to discuss the impact of the cuts on their respective agencies.


IDCHC Director Gail Tanaka said, ""We're all real committed to trying to maintain our level of service despite all these cuts.""


She said those who met -- the directors of the Chinese Information and Service Center (CISC), Asian Counseling and Referral Service (ACRS), Chinatown-International District Preservation and Development Authority (PDA), International District Housing Alliance (IDHA) and Inter-Im -- felt it wouldn't be fair for the City to spread funding cuts across-the-board.


""The City should look at low-income communities and populations with special needs and develop priorities on that basis,"" Tanaka said.


Tanaka said the Health Center, which receives revenue sharing funds, also on the cutting block, ""does not have enough information yet to plan the budget for the rest of the year."" ""We don't know how much we can make up and how much to cut services,"" she said.


The International Drop-In Center, which primarily serves elderly Filipino clients, appears to be the International District agency most greatly affected by the 16 percent cut. The agency, based in the basement of the Bush-Asia Center, relies almost exclusively on block grant funds to cover operating expenses, including the salary of Director Gus Salgado.


""This has a very serious impact on our services,"" Salgado said, ""We put all our eggs in one basket. I don't know what will happen.""


Inter-Im Director Sue Taoka said of the reduction, ""It's nasty. We may have to close down for a couple of months or have everyone go part-time for several months or find some way to do more fundraising.""


She noted that Inter-Im now faces the prospect of managing the International District Community Garden with volunteer staffing. The funding reduction could also halt Inter-Im's research into the possibility of federal housing for the District and other work on land use issues, she said.


Theresa Fujiwara, executive director of ACRS, said that if the 16 percent cut stands, her agency will lose about $12,000 from three programs -- emergency services, skills training for refugees, and elderly information and assistance.


Although $12,000 is only a small amount of the agency's total budget, the money is used to pay for rooms rented as emergency shelter and operation of the food bank.


""We already run the programs pretty lean, so it's not as simple as reducing the number of bags we distribute in the food bank,"" she said.


""Since Reagan has come into office, we've been facing cut after cut. The problem is that we don't know whether we can tighten our belts anymore. I don't know that we can pull the cinch one more notch.""


Rita Wang, director of CISC, said her agency will lose over $10,000, most of which will come from the elderly program, which currently uses six full-time staff positions. ""Funding for this program has been barely enough, and now it will be real bad,"" she said.


Additionally, Wang said, CISC's employment assistance program will lose money from its sole source. The program serves middle-aged and elderly clients who speak little or no English, a population not served by any other program. ""It would be very bad if we can't pay our own job developer,"" she remarked.


Although CISC is a United Way agency, that source isn't sufficient to make up for the reduction in government funds. ""It's very scary because more than 57 percent of our total agency funds come from government grants,"" Wang said.


IDHA Director Michio Teshima said two-thirds of the budget of his agency's housing and tenant assistance program comes from the CDBG program. The program, which helps individuals who have limited English-speaking skills find affordable housing, would face a cut in staffing.


""I don't know how we can make up the cuts,"" Teshima said. ""We've been doing some pretty exhaustive fundraising already.""


Fortunately for the PDA, the CDBG reduction will not affect a $393,000 block grant allocation to help the PDA renegotiate the mortgage on the Bush Hotel. The money was allocated before the end of last year, PDA Director Ben Woo explained.


However, the PDA will lose about $14,000 in block grant funding for this year, which could have some impact on the PDA's services, such as the elderly meal program, Woo said. ""We're still going to do some bleeding, and it could well be at the end of the year that we would have to reduce services,"" he said.


Meanwhile, the City is organizing three community meetings to explain how the CDBG cuts will affect specific programs and discuss with community representatives how they can fight the proposed reductions. Meetings will be held: Monday, January 27, from 1:30 to 3:30 p.m. at the Wallingford Senior Center; Tuesday, January 28, from 2 to 4 p.m. at the Jefferson Park Community Center; and Tuesday, January 28 from 7 to 9 p.m. at the Board of Public Works in the 400 Yesler Building.


Royer noted that the President's decision to defer CDBG funds is not based on the need to meet budget deficit reduction targets under the Gramm-Rudman Bill, but is an attempt to cut domestic and survival service programs in 1986 so that non-do-mestic programs will not have to be cut in 1987.

As we enter the Year of the Tiger, the International District community faces a number of critical issues involving the future development of the area and the quality of life for those who live, work and do business in the International District.


The following are five important issues that will shape the direction of the International District in the coming year.


1) Federal Budget Cuts: With declining federal support almost a certainty in the coming year. International District agencies that provide social and health services to the Asian Pacific American community will have to explore creative fundraising alternatives to sustain current levels of service.


Last month, the City tentatively announced a 16.2 percent across-the-board cut in block grant funding to low-income service programs -- which includes all the major service agencies in the International District. Inevitably, all the cuts in recent years have whittled away at the staffing and morale of those who provide such badly needed services as health care, housing assistance, meal programs, employment training and counseling to the non-English-speaking.


The latest cut, necessitated by President Reagan's recent budget decisions, means, for example, that the International District Improvement Association faces the ridiculous prospect of trying to maintain the community garden, recognized as a model for the nation, with volunteer staffing. The Chinese Information and Service Center faces the ironic situation of being unable to pay the salary of a staffperson for its employment assistance program, a unique program serving middle-aged and elderly clients who speak little or no English.


Social service agencies have tried to absorb previous federal cuts without reducing levels of service. They've been able to squeeze additional funds from United Way foundations, patient fees, donations and assorted community fundraisers.


But, because federal support remains critical, there's the very real prospect of service cuts in the coming year, unless community advocates begin to work together to create a groundswell of pressure on Congress.


2) Old Bailey Gatzert School. The International Special Review District Board must decide whether to approve the Indian Services Commission's proposal to tear down the old school and replace it with facilities to serve the Native American community.


The proposal, which calls for construction of a health clinic, a multi-service center and 35 units of senior housing, has sparked opposition from International District business persons who say the project will draw transients into the area and weaken the business community. They say there is already an overabundance of low-income housing and social services in the International District. But their opposition has angered Indian groups who have pooled their hopes for a community center.


The seven members of the Review Board will soon have to make the difficult decision of whether to permit demolition of the old school and construction of the new project. It's a decision that could influence other International District developments east of the freeway.


The International Special Review District guidelines do not specifically prohibit the new project. On the other hand, according to the Review District development regulations, the project is not a ""preferred use"" for that area.


It's unclear whether there's a middle ground on this issue, which has divided business persons and social service advocates, the Asian community and the Native American community. The Review Board's decision, either way, will be controversial.


3) Union Station. Development of the Union Station site as a south transit terminal for Metro's downtown bus tunnel will likely spur new economic development on the western side of the International District an area that has decayed in recent years.


International District businesses -- small shops and restaurants -- need more pedestrian traffic, and the bus station can provide lots of that, inasmuch as the bus tunnel will enable workers in downtown to jet down to the District for lunch and back. Metro will build a link between the transit terminal and the International District across Fifth Avenue and South King Street, encouraging pedestrian flow into the core of the District.


Metro's initial plans for the transit terminal would have left the Union Station site with a below-grade transit platform and an ugly, gaping hole at-grade. The International Special Review District Board, before approving the design of the station platform, worked with Metro to make some major changes the current plan is now to lid the platform area, develop a plaza and make street improvements around the site.


However, President Reagan recently called for elimination of funding for the downtown bus tunnel. Although that's an unlikely prospect, there are strong pressures on Congress to cut spending, and that means community advocates must remain vigilant so Metro doesn't scale back commitments in the station design.


Meanwhile, Seattle Mayor Charles Royer the City Council are considering developing a new civic center to consolidate city operations. Several proposals are under consideration, including Upland Industries Corporation's plan to renovate the old Union Station building and erect several tall structures on the land immediately south of the site.


International District business leaders have told the Mayor that they want the new City Hall built at Union Station.


Development of both a transit terminal and a new civic center on the edge of the District could bring multitudes of people into the area, spurring economic revitalization of the International District. But it could also test the will of the community to provide balance between commercial and residential development.


4) Street People. Although the International District is generally not considered as dangerous as Pike Street, a growing number of street people and hobos have drifted into the area, lured, some merchants and residents say, by the sale of cheap, fortified wine in several groceries in the International District.


It is estimated that King County has over 3,000 homeless people, a diverse group that includes the mentally ill, street youth, chronic alcoholics, unemployed workers and women with children. Some harass passersbys to get money, others are battered women and children just trying to survive.


Social service providers want to give these people more assistance in finding housing, employment, food and counseling. Business persons generally want these people put away or driven from the area. Both agree on the need for additional safety measures.


Last month, the International Special Review District Board recommended that the City not renew the liquor license of a business that has refused to stop the sale of fortified wine. Three other businesses, whose liquor licenses expire later this year are expected to meet the same response from the Board, which is responding to community outrage over the increasing number of street people gravitating to the International District.


The fortified wine issue, which must ultimately be decided by the State Liquor Control Board, has pitted those four businesses, who argue that their livelihood depends on the sale of fortified wine, against others who argue that steps must be taken to halt the flow of street people into the area.


Even if the Review Board policy is upheld, the problem of street people and the homeless will not go away. Shooing them from one neighborhood to another doesn't contribute to a long-term, city-wide solution.


5) Seattle Chinatown-International District Preservation and Development Authority (PDA). This year will be a crucial year for the public authority which spearheaded renovation of the Bush Hotel into the new Bush-Asia Center, an active community center for the International District.


The PDA was established 10 years ago to serve as the area's major vehicle for preservation and development. But it has been weighed down by financial problems, caused, in part, by delays in completion of its projects. It has moved slowly toward self-sufficiency.


But, as PDA Council chair Paul Mar told PDA constituents in a December meeting the agency has ""finally reached that turn in the corner."" This spring, the PDA is expected to complete two major projects: renovation of a building on Seventh Avenue and South Jackson to house the Wing Luke Memorial Museum and an Asian American Theater, and renovation. The storefront and basement of the New Central Hotel, at Maynard Avenue and South Weller, for new businesses and offices.


Thanks largely to an allocation of $393,000 from the City of Seattle to reduce the Bush-Asia Center mortgage as well as improvements in PDA management the agency forecasts a modest profit from operations this year. If this optimistic forecast is realized, it will lay the foundation for development of other projects in the area.

Mount Baker Apartment residents had just finished telling one of the owners and a health department inspector about the infestation of rodents in the buildings when a small brown mouse, squealing in terror, darted across the file floor and into a hole in the corner.


No one at the special meeting earlier this month was surprised. Mice and rats far outnumber tenants at the south Seattle apartment complex and have been a problem for many months. On the day of the meeting, a health inspector caught 14 in only four units. Residents said traps were being sprung as soon as they were set down.


In an encounter that could have been from a horror movie, Mrs. Michael Ruta told of how a rat attacked her one morning last month.


""I had just finished breakfast,"" Mrs. Ruta recalled. ""I opened a drawer in the kitchen and a big gray rat jumped out."" She held her hands 10 inches apart to indicate its size. She quickly sought refuge in the next room and the rat scurried across the kitchen floor and under the refrigerator where she had placed a dish of rat poison.


""I could hear him chewing it,"" she said. ""A couple of minutes later he was tearing around the kitchen. 'Bang, bang, bang!' I could hear him making noise.""


Mrs. Ruta went in after the rat, which was by now foaming at the mouth. She succeeded in grabbing it by the tail and throwing it out the front door, but only after it had bitten her three times on her hands. She said she is still receiving medical treatment for the wounds.


Most of the 40 or so residents who came to the meeting spoke of mice rather than rats.


""The building has been filled with mice for many days,"" complained Tekeste Micael. ""My wife caught 15 of them the other day.""


Radha Manickam said his children are frightened. ""They are afraid of going from one room to another,"" he said. ""If they want to go from the bathroom to the living room I have to accompany them.""


Perry Lee of the Seattle Health Department was sympathetic and said he was in the process of inspecting each apartment for sanitary conditions and setting down the 550 glue traps provided by building owners.


Throughout the meeting, there was a trap on display - three baby mice, still alive and squirming, were mired up to their bellies in a transparent non-drying adhesive.


Lee, a Chinese American, was assigned to take care of this problem because of his affinity with the Asian community. Most of the apartment dwellers are refugees from Southeast Asia. Lao, Cambodian and Kmhmu interpreters were at the meeting Ethiopians and other Africans, as well an black and white Americans, also live at the low-income, privately-owned apartments.


Lee and some of the residents identified poor sanitation as the cause of the infestation. Many of the refugees are from farming communities in poor Third Work countries where garbage is used as compost.


""Some people just throw food outside their doors,"" said Lee. Traps, he added, are not the complete answer. ""There's no quick solution. It'll take door-to-door education.""


Sister Michele MacMillan, a former resident and a tireless activist for refugee causes, agreed that education is the key, but she saw the need for a more comprehensive approach.


""We've been begging the city and health department to give us an education program like the one we had six years ago,"" she said. At what time, the King County Cooperative oversaw a six-month program for refugees. In weekly meetings, health department officials with the help of interpreters, explained, the basics of proper sanitation.


""Now there's a whole new population at the apartments,"" said Sister Michele. People who haven't gone through the education program, she said, ""really need it.""


In the coming weeks, traps will be installed and holes plugged. Inspector Lee estimated the process will take at least a month.


The rodent problem at Mount Baker is only one of many in recent years. Among the most glaring:


Overcrowding. At one point 1,300 people were jammed into the 180-unit complex originally designed to house 400.


Structural defects. Leaky roofs and sagging walls and ceilings continue to plague the apartments. Last August and September, the Department of Construction and Land Use found many code violations and issued emergency 30-day repair orders in 26 units. Some families had to be relocated.


-- Pests. Cockroaches as well as rodents are a constant problem.


-- Crime. Break-ins have been on the rise.""


The owners, SMJ Associates, have been accused of foot-dragging in the past, but now appear responsive. At this month's meeting, co-owner. Ted Jones promised that exterminators would spray all units for cockroaches by the end of the month. He also said that the owners plan a major rehabilitation this summer.


The need is critical. ""Good housing is particularly important for refugees,"" said Dorothy Lengyel of the city's Department of Community Development. ""If they don't have stable housing, they can't blend into the American mainstream and become economically self-sufficient.""


More low-income housing would seem to be the answer, but the city doesn't know where the money will come from.


The city, which Lengyel says has been ""closely monitoring"" Mount Baker conditions since last July, is looking at new ways to finance the construction and renovation of low-income housing. She said the city has approached federal officials for an emergency allocation of funds. Additional help may come in the form of an appropriations bill now under consideration by potential sponsors in the state senate.


Of course bureaucratic processes and the negotiations for funding will take time to complete. Meanwhile, time may be running out for the refugees. Under the Reagan administration, refugees are receiving 18 months of federal aid instead of the 36 originally promised. Current federal budget considerations may further diminish federal funding. Many of the refugees are now nearing the 18-month limit.


""There may be a situation in the non-too distant future when the refugees have no income at all,"" warned Lengyel. ""It's totally unrealistic to expect them to adapt in 18 months.""

When President Reagan delivered his State of the Union address on February 4, he painted a picture of prosperity, lower unemployment, lower inflation and hailed ""America's great comeback."" He said his major goals for the coming year included passage of his budget, lowering the federal deficit, no tax increases and a stronger defense.


The next day, he presented his 1987 budget, a statement of government spending priorities. The proposed budget, although totaling nearly an astounding one trillion dollars, is a harbinger of hard times ahead for the poor people of America.


President Reagan would like to allocate $311.6 billion in spending authority for the Defense Department, an increase of over $33 billion over 1986. In comparison, the total 1986 budget allocation for health was $35.7 billion.


The Reagan 1987 budget calls for an estimated $6.3 billion cut in agriculture, a $700 million cut in health, a $3.2 billion cut in education and a $1.6 billion cut in transportation.


The Reagan budget leaves every major weapons programs intact. Approximately $95 billion is earmarked for weapons purchases, including $3.1 billion for purchase of 21 submarine-launched intercontinental ballistic missiles. In contrast. Reagan has requested cuts of $2.6 billion in education spending, primarily from student financial aid and vocational education programs.


Increase defense spending would enable the military to continue large purchases of tanks, ships and planes. At the same time, $700 million would be cut from federal job training programs. Reagan wants to allocate approximately $4.8 billion to the ""Star Wars"" missile defense program while, at the same time, scuttling such programs as the Legal Services Corporation and the Small Business Administration. Reagan would like to escalate defense spending to $1.8 trillion over the next five years, a figure of $7,800 for each man, woman, and child living in America.


With drastic cuts in aid to cities, housing construction, urban development and mass transit, Reagan plans to leave local governments to fend for themselves. Community social service agencies which offer a wide range of nutrition, health care and youth services have no place in the Reagan scheme of things.


Inflated defense spending is justified, in the words of Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, because this spending improves the U.S. military's strategic position with the Soviet Union and strengthens the President's bargaining power with the Soviet Union at arms control talks and summit meetings. This rationale, however, is truly Orwellian -- we must build up our military weaponry to enhance our position at negotiations with the Soviets to limit our military weaponry.


In his address, President Reagan focused at length on his concern for the poor. Reagan maintains that his administration is committed to maintaining a safety net for the ""truly needy."" Yet, the effect of his cuts will be to devastate programs for the poor. With reductions in housing and social services, is it any wonder that every major city in the country has a problem with the homeless? Reagan's concern for the poor is demonstrated by his almost obsessive crusade to eliminate Legal Services on the pretext that private attorneys should do more. Sure, everybody should do more to help the poor. The Reagan administration philosophy toward serving the poor is: ""Do as I say, not as I do.""


Another obsessive Reagan theme is making sure no welfare chiseler takes advantage of the welfare program. In his address, Reagan argued that welfare programs promote dependency, that the welfare system needs overhauling, and that he wanted to take immediate action to solve the problems of the poor. Did Reagan restore budget cuts in nutrition programs? No. Did Reagan restore budget cuts in housing programs? No. Did Reagan restore cuts in aid to cities which fund social services? No. His immediate action to solve the problems of the poor was to order his aides to conduct a study of the welfare system by December 1.


And while nation's poor anxiously await the results of the survey, defense contractors will line their pockets off lucrative contracts which the budget will allow. The days of the $100 hammer and the $500 screwdriver are coming. It is common practice to inflate costs to increase the contract awards. Because we, the taxpayers, are responsible for providing 40 percent of the budget dollar, the largest source of revenue, we are the ones ultimately bilked.


On February 6, a federal grand jury in Seattle indicted two local defense contractors. One contractor is accused of bilking the Defense Department out of $243,000 by deliberately substituting 1,759 defective M-14 rifles in its shipment to the Army. This scheme continued for 17 months. The other sub-contractor was accused of diverting $281,000 which should have gone to other subcontractors. While there may be welfare chiselers out there somewhere, they would have to be pretty sophisticated to get away with over $200,000. Reagan does not seem to show the same disgust with the cheating defense subcontractors.


Reagan has defended his budget cuts as necessary for eliminating the federal deficit. When Reagan assumed the Presidency, he blamed the federal deficit on his Democratic predecessor, attributing the unfairness of cuts in social service programs and other anti-poverty programs to the folly of Democratic policies. When Reagan became President in 1981, the federal deficit was $79 billion. In 1985, the federal deficit was $212 billion.


This time around, Congressional leaders aren't too happy about the increasing deficit and the rise in defense spending. It is unlikely the Reagan budget will emerge intact. Having a strong defense is predicated on the belief that America is worth saving. In this election year, Congressional leaders are very leery about the impact of Reagan's budget on their constituents. Military weapons can't vote.

This past week, many people have been celebrating the victory of President Corazon Aquino and the ouster of Ferdinand Marcos.


But, despite all the joy at the turn of events in the Philippines, people must remain vigilant against the prospect of U.S. intervention in the Philippines.


In the first place, why did Marcos place himself on the ballot to be judged by those he had oppressed? What did Marcos, a shrewd, experienced political animal, have to gain? The answers to these questions probably lie with the leverage applied by the unseen hand of the United States.


The U.S. needed a ""credible"" government in the Philippines to stem the growing tide of Communism and provide a stable environment for the only U.S. military naval foothold in Asia.


When Marcos announced a ""snap election"" -- the words indicating how quickly the decision to hold an election can be made -- the fractured opposition unified and waged a strong grassroots campaign. Throughout this period, the U.S. media visited our homes day and night with images of an oppressive and sickly dictator, a sharp contrast to the media's 10-year silence about martial law. It was as if the U.S. press was preparing the American people to dump Marcos as our ""long-time friend and ally.""


President Reagan's initial congratulations on Marcos's victory as an indication of the strength of the Philippine two-party system, despite reports of widespread fraud, remind us of the hard reality of Marcos's hold on the U.S. bases.


It also implies that Philippine democracy, after all, may not be as important to the U.S. as the bases.


The courageous and disciplined support of the Filipino people, the military defection and the international pressure brought about the resignation of Marcos. The peaceful transition brought international respect for the leadership of President Corazon . . .


But this joyful, . . . to freedom should be viewed with a sense of caution. What if the U.S. had decided, based on the U.S. interest in the bases, to intervene on the side of Marcos?


And now comes the most difficult part of a revolution: reconstruction. Will the U.S. impound Marcos's interests? Will it recognize that Marcos's booty rightfully belongs to the Filipino people as a gift of aid from American taxpayers? Will it provide permanent asylum for Marcos against the warnings of Filipino Americans that his presence reflects poorly on the United States and is a security threat to the Filipino American community that opposed Marcos? Will the U.S. continue aid regardless of the outcome of the military bases?


Corazon Aquino also has a long list of questions to answer relating to the future of her people. Aquino's candor and plain straight talk is a welcomed relief from the doublefalk of other politicians. But it remains to be seen how well she can address the economic and social ravages created by the Marcos regime, given her accountability to a wide spectrum of supporters.

The government of Ferdinand Marcos is finished. Twenty years of political struggle is now over, a visiting Filipino political scientist said before an audience of almost 50 people at the University of Washington last week.


Drawing an analogy from the comic strip Doonesbury, Dr. Joel Rocamora, professor at the University of California at Berkeley, said that, just like the character Duke, Marcos is part of the living dead and he'll soon be buried. ""Please excuse me if I say I don't care if it's a political burial or a physical burial,"" he said.


Rocamora's visit to Seattle was sponsored by the University of Washington's Political Science Department. Rocamora, who has a doctorate in political science from Cornell University, is also the director of the Philippine Resource Center (PRC). PRC serves as a key source of information and ""action-alert"" services for Philippine support groups in the United States and Canada.


Commenting on the role of the U.S. in the eventual downfall of Marcos, he said diplomatic negotiator Philip Habib ""was sent to the Philippines by Reagan as a deodorant to Marcos and a tranquilizer to Aquino.""


In response to Habib, Marcos offered some concessions like the trial of Assemblyman Pacificador for his involvement in a politically-motivated murder almost three years ago. These concessions, however, are in Rocamora's words, ""a bucket of water down Niagara Falls.""


Rocamora described the entry of General Fidel Ramos and now Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile to the Corazon Aquino's camp as crucial in the reconciliation of the two warring factions in the Philippine elite.


Rocamora described Enrile and Ramos, who were active participants in Marcos's repressive regime for almost 20 years, as the only persons capable of assuring the Marcos people that retribution by President Aquino will be prevented.


Although he welcomes the downfall of Marcos, Rocamora said, ""The Marcos dictatorship will not just disappear when many of Marcos's men leave the country to live off their Swiss bank accounts. Not all Marcos's supporters can leave.""


He stressed that Aquino will be forced to make a lot of concessions. To varying degrees, she'll also face political instability in the provinces. And she will have to contend with cause-oriented groups affiliated with BAYAN (the New Patriotic Alliance), whose more than two million militant members will continue to demand abrogation of the treaty allowing U.S. military bases, implementation of genuine land reform, lifting of the ban on the right to strike and unconditional release of all political detainees.


Rocamora noted that Aquino and Enrile are big landlords who will never enter a coalition with the New People's Army (NPA) whose program is based on genuine land reform.


""In fact, Rocamora said, ""Aquino does not want to work with the Left to avoid U.S. anger.""


He described the new political set-up in the Philippines as ""a rearrangement of who controls what in the upper middle class.""


""The new government is going to follow the policies that eventually led to the creation of the Marcos dictatorship. The U.S. will still play a significant role.""


Rocamora concluded, ""I would like to be surprised by the new government. I suspect that I might not be surprised.""

The turning point in Ferdinand Marcos's last stand to remain in power occurred when the Filipino people refused to be manipulated into legitimizing his fradulent re-election. The explosive anger of the people erupted into a powerful force that eventually destroyed Marcos's dictatorial rule. Filipinos, tempered in the struggle for 20 years, refused to give Ronald Reagan another excuse for supporting the dictator. In the end, despite a persistent U.S. hand, the Filipinos themselves made the difference.


Although Marcos is now out of the political scene, Filipinos must remain vigilant because President Corazon Aquino and Vice President Salvador Laurel came from the same type of ruling clique from which Marcos emerged. How Aquino, Laurel and Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile -- who are all big landlords -- handle the semi-feudal structure of Philippine society will eventually determine their brand, of leadership.


A recent editorial by the Seattle Post-Intelligencer described the new government in the Philippines as emerging from ""a revolution of the middle-class political center."" In other words, what happened in the Philippines recently can be described simply as the transfer of political power from one faction of the ruling elite to another faction of the same elite, which, in the past 20 years, had been displaced by Marcos.


The entry of Enrile and General Fidel Ramos, now Armed Forces Chief of Staff, is seen by many as part of the U.S. plan. The two former hatchetmen of Marcos will serve as a bridge in pacifying the Aquino camp and some Marcos loyalists who still wield political power. The ultimate goal is to unify the two warring factions. Enrile and Ramos are in full control of the military and they have the potential to dictate their terms to the new president.


The characterization of the Aquino-Laurel tandem as a ""progressive electoral slate"" completely defies conventional political logic. If the Aquino slate is indeed ""progressive,"" it would be less likely to receive aid from the Reagan administration. But immediately after Aquino's inauguration as President, Secretary of State George Shultz said the U.S. ""stands ready as always to cooperate and assist the Philippines as the government of President Aquino engages the problems of economic development and national security.""


Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger and die-hard Marcos critic Representative Stephen Solarz also got into the act by calling for more military aid in order to retrain the members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. The only logical conclusion why the Philippine military needs to be retrained is to counter the growing militancy of the Filipinos, particularly the growth of the New People's Army.


Aquino, who is clearly pro-American, deserves due recognition for her unique role in bringing down the dictator Marcos. However, some quarters have expressed skepticism about her stand on certain democratic demands.


For example, on the issue of U.S. military bases, her position is no different from that of Marcos: to respect the bases treaty until 1991, then renegotiate at that point. She has also not said a word about American responsibility for the country's economic and political crisis. Her position on genuine land reform, nationalization of vital industries and repudiation of foreign loans that do not benefit the people is not at all clear. Her vacillation on these issues will adversely affect her desire to bring real progress to the Philippines.


During the last few days, there have been developments in the Philippines which are causes for concern. As of this writing, there are still political detainees, despite Aquino's promise to release all of them. A case in point is Jose Maria Sison and Bernabe Buscayno. By declaring the people's committees illegal and calling on the people to respect Marcos's appointed local officials, she is too soon putting a tight reign on the very people who brought her into power.


Petty conflicts have already started between Aquino and Laurel who both appointed their own respective mayors in the commercial district of Makati in the persons of Johnny Wilson and Jejomar Binay. A similar thing happened in Pampanga where both Aquino and Laurel camps wanted to put their own man in as governor of the province.


True, it is still too early to judge Cory Aquino. But one thing is certain: To retain the support of the people, she has to make herself accountable to popular demands. As one political scientist put it, ""The test of Cory's leadership is how she will respond when the first post-Marcos demonstrations take place.""

On February 26, millions of Filipinos celebrated the end of the Ferdinand Marcos dictatorship in the Philippines. As President Corazon Aquino forms a new government, she faces tremendous task in rebuilding the country and instituting genuine democracy and justice.


Particularly pressing is the extreme poverty of peasants who make up 70 percent of the Philippine population. Two leaders in the Kilusang Magbubukid ng Pilipinas (KMP), the Peasant Movement of the Philippines, Felicisimo Patayan and Francisco Lara, visited Seattle February 18 to 21 to discuss land reform.


Patayan, a 72-year-old peasant, is vice-chair of the KMP, a member of the National Executive Council of BAYAN (New Patriotic Federation), the director of BAYAN's Economic Planning Commission and a former political detainee.


Lara is an executive officer for the Philippine Peasant Institute, which conducts training and research for the KMP, and sits on the Popular Struggles Commission of BAYAN.


Their visit here began a tour of the U.S. and Canada, coordinated by the Canada-Asia Working Group, Alliance for Philippine Concerns and Philippine Resource Center. It is the first time in over 50 years that a Philippine peasant leader has visited the U.S. Local sponsors included the Filipino Association for Community Education, Philippine Workers Support Committee, East Wind Magazine and the Coalition for Human Concerns.


Patayan and Lara met with Seattle City Councilman Sam Smith, Reverend William Cate of the Church Council of Greater Seattle, representatives of El Centro de la Raza and local labor leaders. They spoke with students and faculty at the University of Washington, The Evergreen State College and Seattle University, and gave the keynote address at a community program.


They explained that the KMP and BAYAN had decided to boycott the recent Philippine elections. The KMP, Patayan said, had ""presented a minimum program"" to Aquino and Unido, Salvador Laurel's party, ""but nothing has been accepted."" Lara added, ""We just didn't want to participate when the rules are already rigged in favor of one team and we know who will win the game.""


Lara stressed that discussion is now focused on building greater unity among opposition groups to achieve genuine land reform, reverse the land-grabbing of transnational corporations and stop the militarization of the countryside.


Presently, 78 percent of the peasants do not own their land. Big landlords control 75 percent of the 13 million hectares cultivated. Transnational corporations control thousands of hectares. Under Marcos, the Agricultural Development Incentives Act granted foreigners 60 percent equity participation and ownership of lands planted for priority export crops such as coffee or yellow corn.


Most lands which could be targeted for land reform are planted for export crops. This aggravates the dispossession of peasants, leading to mass starvation in the countryside.


For example, Lara explained, on the island of Negros, hunger and malnutrition is rampant, and children die from starvation. The people need to grow food, yet on 100,000 hectares mortgaged by sugar planters, the government made a joint arrangement with U.S. and Canadian corporations to plant yellow corn for pig feed. The peasants have organized around the demand: ""We want food, not feed! The people must come before the pigs!""


Other U.S. corporations participating in land-grabbing include Del Monte (24,000 hectares), Dole (30,000 hectares), Castle and Cook, which plants pineapple, and Firestone, B.F. Goodrich, Goodyear, and Dunlop, which own huge rubber plantations.


Patayan explained that the Philippine military protects these corporations and has helped seize peasant lands. The growing militarization of the rural areas is evident in the government's ""strategic hamletting"" programs, modeled after the programs used during the Vietnam War. These programs, supposidly for protecting peasants from the rebel New People's Army, are actually used to seize more peasant land to commit for export crops and agribusiness profits.


During martial law, Marcos increased the military from 50,000 to 250,000 soldiers, in addition to 75,000 paramilitary troops. By 1985, Marcos was receiving over $100 million per year in military aid from the U.S. ""Picture the arms sent by Reagan, bought with your tax dollars,"" Patayan said. ""They are killing the poor farmers.""


Under Marcos, the Philippine land reform program only affected one-tenth of one percent of the peasants. Patayan noted that at this rate it would take over 400 years to benefit all the peasants. A study by the Philippine Peasant Institute revealed that the land designated for reform was limited to only two crops and affected only 730,000 hectares of the 13 million under cultivation.


The KMP intends to strongly advocate for meaningful land reform. The KMP, a national federation with 52 provincial and regional chapters, represents over 500,000 members and has over two million supporters. ""Last October,"" Patayan said, ""we launched the first island-wide peasant strike on Panay and stopped 90 percent of operations with an estimated loss of five billion pesos to the government.""


Patayan said the KMP has also initiated peasant strikes, ""selling products only to friends and not to enemies."" KMP has worked with other members of BAYAN, such as the Kilusang Mayo Uno (KMU) and the May First Movement, a national labor federation. KMP and KMU coordinated strikes of coconut oil plant workers and coconut agricultural workers in Mindanao.


Filipinos can and will rebuild the Philippines if grassroots movements like the KMP are recognized and their programs adopted by the new government, he said. U.S. aid, economic or otherwise, is not the answer.


""Nothing else can liberate us from our sufferings but ourselves,"" Patayan said.

The City of Seattle, faced with declining federal money for domestic programs, has developed a proposal for ""a new kind of partnership"" with the International District, David Moseley, director of the City's Department of Community Development (DCD), said at a community meeting last week.


Moseley, speaking to the Council members of the Seattle Chinatown-International District Preservation and Development Authority (PDA), said DCD has formed a City team to work ""in a concerted way"" on International District issues. Doug Chin will work on housing; Phil Fujii, land use; and Junko Whitaker, economic development.


Moseley added that the City would like to propose the establishment of a permanent International District advisory group -- representative of the different community interests -- that would guide and assist the work of the DCD team.


An advisory group in the Denny Regrade, which has been helpful in identifying projects for the area, is the model for the International District advisory group, Moseley said.


In the past, Moseley said, the City directly targeted ""quite a bit"" of federal money to the revitalization of the International District. Even if Congress does not totally accept President Reagan's proposal for the ""complete withdrawal of the federal government as a partner in domestic programs,"" Moseley said, the City will have much less money to allocate in the future.


""That arena is changing in a dramatic way that I don't think people really understand,"" he said. ""This means -- for the City -- that we're going to have to be smarter about how we're going to produce some things. We're not withdrawing from the ID, but we have to look at a new kind of partnership.""


Practically, the establishment of a DCD team will not change the City's, staffing support for the International District since all three members of the team already work on International District issues.


Those at last week's PDA meeting suggested additional issues for the DCD team to address and asked specific questions about the proposed advisory group.


PDA Council Chair Paul Mar noted that the International District consists of many different interest groups. ""The larger the advisory group,"" he added, ""the more in-put you're going to get, and the slower the wheels will turn.""


PDA Executive Director Ben Woo said he believed it would be difficult to pull together a representative group that ""won't go flying apart on a particular issue.""


In the coming weeks, Moseley and members of the new DCD team are expected to meet with other District groups to outline the DCD changes and peddle the idea of a permanent ID advisory group.


Chin said the DCD team hopes to convene an initial meeting of the advisory group sometime next month.


Chin explained that he, Whitaker and Fujii will meet regularly to discuss and coordinate their work, eliminating past problems of ""confusion resulting from different people getting involved in the same issue.""


Chin said he will work with the advisory group on developing housing strategies and goals, and defining the balance between low-income and middle-income housing.


Whitaker explained that she will coordinate development of a booklet profiling housing and economic development opportunities in the International District. DCD would publish this booklet, providing market information for private developers, during the first part of 1987, Whitaker said.


""Since DCD has limited resources,"" Fujii remarked, ""the idea is to rechannel some of that money into a document that could spur private developers to invest in projects in the International District.""


Fujii, staff coordinator of the International Special Review District Board, has begun work on preparation of another booklet. His document, Fujii said, will explain and illustrate the development guide-lines that govern the International District as a special, protected area of the City. Many business and community groups still do not understand that they must receive approval from the Review Board before they set up shop in the area or make changes to buildings or signs. Fujii said his document will be completed this summer.


Chin and Fujii are also developing a plan for on-street parking -- studying the placement of load zones, parking meters and angle parking spaces. Business complaints about the unavailability of parking for customers sparked this new parking study.

I am tired of hearing the Reagan administration justify its militaristic, diplomacy through black propaganda.


Before the invasion of Grenada in 1983, the U.S. branded the late Prime Minister Maurice Bishop a ""protege of Fidel Castro."" Later, the U.S. criticized the construction of Point Salines Airport as a possible refueling station for Cuban aircraft en route to Africa. Yet the U.S. was silent on the much better airport facilities of nearby Barbados and Trinidad. Grenada was also accused of militarizing, with the aid of Cuba. Yet the U.S. invading forces never found substantial military hardware such as anti-aircraft, fuel storage, bombers or a Soviet missile in the middle of the island as earlier claimed.


Playing the same propaganda game, the present administration has called the government of Nicaragua ""an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security of the United States."" Yet the U.S. is silent on the increasing number of civilians being killed by the U.S.-backed contras.


One must ask: How can a nation with less than three million people, the majority of whom are young, with a per capita income of $804 per year, threaten a powerful nation like the U.S.?


Supporting the repressive governments of El Salvador, Chile, Guatemala, Honduras, the Philippines, Korea and South Africa ""in the name of freedom and democracy"" is another propaganda ploy that leads me to ask: Does the U.S. have a monopoly on freedom and democracy?


Why should the U.S. intervene in the internal affairs of another sovereign state?


Why should the U.S. impose its own brand of freedom and democracy on other people?


The Reagan administration's proclivity to see red in countries where the exploited, as a class, cry out for food, jobs, justice and independence is a false premise that only serves Reagan's foreign policy, often described as a return to the John Foster Dulles view of diplomacy as ""a warning of possible hostilities.""


Taken in this context, the invasion of Grenada becomes a model of how the U.S. will intervene -- not necessarily because of the Marxists or Communists -- but once its major interests are threatened.


The trend toward U.S. military intervention to stop social transformation in the Third World is very much in line with its own preservation as a capitalistic society. The U.S. needs to be militarily superior and aggressive to protect its own economic interests and survival.


Military intervention is easy for the U.S. to justify in propaganda terms because it has historically defined national security in terms of its economic interests.


Many Americans who have been literally brainwashed by anti-Communist tirades suffer a kind of political numbness, failing to understand the different needs of different people. Any signs of social transformation initiated by the oppressed and the exploited is immediately viewed as Communist-inspired. Any revolutionary group that sincerely questions the American economic and political system is branded ""terrorist.""


But in every country, it is precisely when the majority of the people with certain interests are pitted against the minority with their own interests that social transformation occurs.


Thus, the Reagan propagandists and the people of Nicaragua, El Salvador, the Philippines, South Africa and other politically-awakened nations have different visions. At best, the Reagan apologists may see manifestations of exploitation and inequality in these countries and offer their own solution. But the people in these countries perceive how the structure of exploitation arose, how it is maintained and how it should be changed according to their needs.


If all this means anything, it means that propaganda can be used differently for different reasons. While it is true that it can be used to mobilize the forces of change, it can also be used to maintain an oppressive relationship among nations.

President Ronald Reagan almost always congratulates Olympic Gold Medal winners, Superbowl champs, World Series heroes, spelling bee winners, Oscar-winning celebrities, artificial heart recipients, newly elected or re-elected right wing dictators and military generals who invade real little countries like Grenada. But he never congratulates ""housewives"" who lead revolutions.


Vice President George Bush, in honoring Ferdinand Marcos a few years ago, described him as ""a great humanitarian.""


Who's advising our leaders in Washington, D.C.? One minute we display arrogance, and the next adoration. Doesn't Reagan know that the ""housewife"" now controls those ever important military bases? One little phone call now might dispel the notion that we are led by an arrogant thespian who hates Communists and revolutionary housewives.


I remember how much influence Marcos once had in our communities here in the U.S.? Several years ago, I and several anti-Marcos protesters -- demonstrating peacefully outside the Philippine Consulate in Seattle -- were physically assaulted by Consulate agents. I ran up to the fourth floor of the building and was confronted by two Seattle Police Officers standing guard outside the Consulate office. I registered an official complaint about the assault, but the officers refused to investigate the matter. I then met with then Police Chief Robert Hanson to register the same complaint, but the issue was never investigated. The message came across that foreign agents, protected by local law enforcement officers, could use their own discretion when dealing with anti-Marcos demonstrators.


In the past few weeks, there has been renewed interest in a civil suit brought on behalf of Silme Domingo and Gene Viernes, two anti-Marcos activists slain in 1981. The Committee for Justice for Domingo and Viernes believes the two were murdered as part of a conspiracy to silence the anti-Marcos opposition in the United States.


It is practical to assume that Marcos stopped at nothing to suppress the prominent anti-Marcos movement in Seattle. The murders, however, brought new resolve to anti-Marcos activists interested in exposing the dictator and his family as power hungry animals who care nothing about the people they professed to represent.


The Committee contends that our own government got caught up in the nasty murder scheme and worked hand-in-hand with the Marcos agents under the guise of ""National Security."" A few months ago, speaking at a Committee for Justice event, Saul Landau said, ""When you have these two words -- 'National Security' -- you should know two things. First, a crime is being committed and, second, it is being covered up.""


The world has now had an opportunity to see the truth of Landau's statement. The anti-Marcos activists were right about Marcos.


And when the civil suit finally goes to trial in federal court, the world will have a second chance to see the truth of what the anti-Marcos movement had been saying all along.

The Seattle International Film Festival is under way once again and, as usual, a healthy number of Asian and Asian-related films are scheduled. Now in its 11th year, the festival has 14 films of Asian interest to choose from. They range from rediscovered classics to the latest offerings from Japan, China, Hong Kong and India, as well as some unexpected sources -- Australia, England and the U.S.


While the festival takes place again at both the Egyptian Theater on Capitol Hill and the Market Theater in Pike Place Market, it will be one week shorter this year. They'll still show some 140 films, but there will be no repeat showings. It's a good idea to buy advance tickets, as the shows tend to sell out. The ticket booth is open daily from 12 noon. For ticket information and festival updates, call 32-EGYPT.


Since the festival started May 15, two of the 14 Asian films, ""Antonio Gaudi,"" and ""The Funeral,"" both from Japan, have already been shown. Here's the remaining line-up:


""YOKIRO"" Gangsters and geishas served up by one of Japan's best action directors -- Hideo Gosha (""Goyokin,"" ""Bandits Vs. Samurai,"" ""Hunter In The Dark""). Set in 1933, ""Yokiro"" tells the tragic story of a doomed geisha and her estranged gangster father as they struggle against custom and destiny.


Gosha has a penchant for examining the dark side of Japanese tradition. His films are epic melodramas bursting with stylish violence and sex. ""Yokiro"" is the second portion of a trilogy that began with ""Onimasa,"" shown at the film festival two years ago. The trilogy deals with misguided individuals who get caught in explosive situations where traditional Japanese values are mixed with Western influences. ""Yokiro"" stars Ken Ogata (""Ballad Of Narayama,"" ""Mishima"") one of Japan's best actors. This is the film's American premiere. (Thursday, May 22, 7 p.m. Market Theater).


""A GREAT WALL"" Also known as ""The Great Wall Is A Great Wall,"" the title is taken from a quote by Richard Nixon when visiting that site during his historic visit to China in 1972. This U.S.-China co-production revolves around a San Francisco computer executive who takes advantage of the opening of China to visit relatives and introduce his American-born wife and son to his native land.


Peter Wang, the charismatic and eccentric actor featured in ""Chan Is Missing"" and ""Ah Ying,"" stars in this film, which he also directed and co-wrote. Asian American actors Sharon Iwai and Kelvin Han Yee also star.


Count on this to be a funny, insightful examination of the differences and similarities between the U.S. and China, as well as a warm look at Chinese Americans coming to terms with their ancestral land. ""A Great Wall"" has been a big hit at film festivals around the country this year and has been picked up for distribution by Orion Classics, the same company that released ""Dim Sum"" and ""Ran."" (Saturday, May 24, 7 p.m., Egyptian)


""ONE WONDERFUL SUNDAY"" An early film of Akira Kurosawa that is very rarely seen. This is a post-war romance about an impoverished couple -- a practical young factory worker and his romantic fiancee -- as they try to make the most of their one day off together.


The story was influenced by D.W. Griffith and Frank Capra, as well as meager post-war conditions. As with some of Kurosawa's early work, the sentimentality can get a bit woozy, and the ending would probably make even Capra squirm, but this should be a rare treat for Kurosawa buffs -- especially those who attended the recent retrospective at the Neptune. The film will be presented in a brand new print. (Friday May 30, 5 p.m. Egyptian)


""THE CRAZY FAMILY"" One of the more aptly titled films in the festival. Japanese screen families sure have changed since Ozu's time and this wild new comedy has been called ""the ultimate in domestic warfare.""


What can you say about a movie in which the father tries to discipline his teenage kids with a chainsaw? Like the recent ""Family Game,"" this film satirizes the modern Japanese family's preoccupation with the material world. ""Crazy Family"" was directed with no inhibitions by Sogo Ishii. Although the film has an American distributor, the chances are against it getting a regular run here -- it's a little too ""different"" for average tastes. (Friday, May 30, 7 p.m., Market)


""SHANGHAI BLUES"" Another off-beat film, this time from Hong Kong's Tsui Hark (""Butterfly Murders""). From a prologue set in 1937, the film follows two separate but interweaving storylines into the chaotic Shanghai of the late 1940s. It's a frentic, heady mixture of slapstick comedy, historical melodrama and lavish song and dance numbers. It stars Kenny Bee, Sylvia Chang and Sally Yeh, who's been called the Chinese Lucille Ball. This will probably be the only chance to see the film in a Seattle theater. (Saturday, May 31, 7 p.m., Market)


""HORSE"" An old-fashioned ""girl and her horse"" story from Japan. This 1941 film was the last one Akira Kurosawa worked on as an assistant to Kajiro Yamamoto, Kurosawa's mentor, before beginning his own career. By this film, Kurosawa was handling much of the work. He co-wrote the script and edited the film. As assistant director, he handled all the non-studio shooting. The recent documentary ""AK"" included scenes from ""Horse,"" showing the earliest examples of Kurosawa's method of ""painting with horses."" It will be shown in a brand new print. (Sunday, June 1, 4 p.m., Egyptian)


""PARR: THE CROSSING"" The American premiere of a recent Indian film about a young couple who flee their village after attacks by marauding bands who war against the lower castes. Arriving on the outskirts of Calcutta and unable to find work, they agree to take on the dangerous job of driving a herd of animals across a wide river. The crossing is the highlight of the film as the couple battles hunger, the elements, the savageness of the herd and the turbulent river itself. Directed by Goutan Ghose. (Tuesday, June 3, 7 p.m., Egyptian)


""HALF LIFE"" An Australian-made documentary that details the history and effects of nuclear resting in the Marshall Islands in the Pacific. In 1947, the newly-formed United Nations, gave the islands to the U.S. for ""protective custody."" In a 10-year period, the U.S. tested 66 nuclear bombs at Bikini Atoll, destroying the island's environment. During one test, the residents were not evacuated and were used as human guinea pigs to test the effect of fallout. The islands were recently given independence, with President Reagan stating to the islanders: ""You'll always be family to us.""


This is a timely screening since the United Nations will discuss this issue later in the year, and a proposed congressional bill may provide the islanders with redress against the U.S. (Tuesday, June 3, 7 p.m., Market)


""HIGH AND LOW"" One of Akira Kurosawa's best and most powerful films. A combination thriller-detective story-social drama, the film's Japanese title actually translates as ""Heaven and Hell."" The story is about a successful shoe manufacturer whose young son is almost kidnapped. The twist is that the kidnappers mistakenly take the chauffer's son, but demand a ransom anyway that would financially ruin the businessman. This sets up all kinds of moral dilemmas that Kurosawa handles with impressive skill and technical brilliance. The staggering ending will give you plenty to think about. ""High And Low"" stars Toshiro Mifune, Tatsuya Nakadai and Tsutomu Yamazaki. This is also a brand-new print re-subtitled by Audie Bock, Japanese film expert and Kurosawa's translator. (Wednesday, June 4, 7 p.m. Egyptian)


""YELLOW EARTH"" This new feature from mainland China has been hailed as a ""breakthrough film"" for that country's film industry, as well as ""the best Chinese movie since 1949."" The story is set in the arid country of Northern Shaanxi in 1939. It deals with the friendship of a Communist Army soldier and a 12-year-old girl. They meet when the soldier is sent to the girl's village to collect folksongs and introduce the virtues of communism. The soldier doesn't really understand the villagers, and when the girl faces an arranged marriage, he realizes he is powerless to intervene.


Xue Bai has received much praise for giving a beautiful performance as the lonely young girl who has the possibilities of the outside world revealed to her, but cannot escape her plight. ""Yellow Earth"" is the work of first-time director Chen Kaige, a 32-year-old, who has won a number of awards for this film, including the British Film Institute's Film Award for the most original and imaginative film of 1985. The film has a minimum of dialogue, beautiful singing and stunning photography. The extraordinary locales will be familiar to those who saw ""Life"" at the Chinese film series at the Neptune last year. It's been suggested that this is a must-see at this year's festival. The word from California is that China is limiting this film's distribution. No official reason is being given, but it seems there is concern about the film's political candor. (Thursday, June 6, 5 p.m., Egyptian)


""FOR KAYAKO"" This is the latest film by Kohei Oguri, director of the highly-acclaimed ""Muddy River."" His new film follows the love story between a Korean student whose family was displaced to Japan during World War II and a Japanese girl who is raised as the adopted daughter of a mixed Korean and Japanese marriage. The script is based on a novel by the award-winning Korean-Japanese writer. Hwe-Song Lee.


Koreans, as a minority group in Japan, face much discrimination. This can be traced to Korea's brutal colonization by Japan for many years, where the Japanese tried to eradicate Korean culture, language and identity. This legacy is evident in the situation of Koreans living in Japan today, who are forced to assimilate, but denied equality.


While the film does not provide the usual type of social criticism most would expect, ""For Kayako"" is one of the first films in recent years to deal significantly with this issue. Tadao Sato, Japan's leading film critic, called the film ""one of the most beautiful Japanese films of recent years."" (Saturday, June 7, 4 p.m., Egyptian)


""MY BEAUTIFUL LAUNDRETTE"" This new film from England has received nothing but rave reviews. The story takes place in Britain's Asian community, specifically the Pakistani community, and centers on a young Pakistani, Omar, and his efforts to rehabilitate a rundown Laundromat. He gets help from Johnny, a young British punk, formerly entangled with the facist-racist National Front. During the course of events, Omar and Johnny become partners and lovers, and deal with Omar's sleazy cousin and Johnny's former gang.


The film was directed by Stephen Frears and written by Hanif Kureishi, an award-winning Pakistani-English author who is known as a frank commentator on the immigrant experience and the stereotypical representations of Asians in British film and television. After its showing at the festival, the film will have an exclusive run at the Egyptian. (Saturday, June 7, 9:30 p.m., Egyptian)

One of the greatest fears of workers is that, because of disability, they may become unable to support their families. In response to these fears, the federal government administers two separate, but related income maintenance programs for disabled persons who can't engage in any substantial, gainful work: Supplemental Security Income (SSI); and Retirement, Survivors, Disability and Health Insurance (RSDHI), commonly known as Social Security Disability.


In recent years, the Reagan administration has pressured the Social Security Administration to deny more and more claims for SSI and Social Security Disability under the guise of fiscal austerity.


This article will briefly describe the eligibility requirements for each program, the available benefits, how to increase your chances of getting benefits during the application process and how to appeal an adverse decision.


ELIGIBILITY


Social Security Disability provides monthly monetary benefits to disabled workers who have established a considerable work history in Social Security covered-employment.


Specifically, an applicant must have worked 20 quarters of the last 40 quarter period, ending with the quarter in which the person became disabled. After 1977, the applicant is required to earn at least $250 for each quarter or three month period of coverage. Certain members of the covered worker's family may also be eligible for these benefits.


Disabled workers ineligible for Social Security Disability because they have not worked long enough in Social Security-covered employment may be eligible to receive benefits through the SSI program. SSI eligibility is determined by the applicant's limited income and resources and whether that person meets disability requirements.


Both programs require the applicant to have a severe disability, defined as ""an inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.""


The key phrase is ""substantial gainful activity."" The work must involve significant productive duties, not minimal or trifling duties useless to the employer. For instance, if the worker needs a lot of supervision or assistance to perform ordinary tasks, the work may not be significant or productive. ""Gainful"" work is work for which one gets paid. As long as a particular job exists in significant numbers either in the applicant's area or in several areas of the country, the work is considered ""gainful,"" even if there are no current openings for that kind of position.


As you can see, eligibility requirements for disability are very tough to meet because the programs were designed only to aid the severely disabled.


THE APPLICATION


A disability application form must be filed in the claimant's district or with a branch Social Security office. A claims representative will usually interview the applicant and, if necessary, help complete the process. The Social Security Act requires a five month waiting period from the onset of disability before Social Security Disability benefits will be paid. A claimant for either program must be alive at the time of application. For Social Security Disability, benefits will still be paid to a surviving widow or widower if the claimant dies within three months after the application.


It is the claimant's responsibility to prove eligibility through medical evidence provided primarily by health professionals. The claimant can help the case by making sure this information reaches Social Security. For example, hospital records showing the continuing nature of the impairment and objective test results, such as x-rays, reports and records of treatment, are very valuable evidence. A written statement by the claimant's family physician, detailing results of treatment, effects of current medication and limitations on activities, is also valuable. The physician's mere conclusion that the claimant is disabled is less helpful than a detailed description of the disabling condition. Other medical professionals who have seen the claimant regularly -- such as nurses or physical therapists -- can describe the person's limitations.


The claimant's past employers and coworkers can provide valuable testimony that the claimant was a responsible and productive worker until the disability and is now incapable of continuing that work because of the disability.


Finally, the claimant's family or housemates may be able to describe how the claimant's life was significantly altered by the onset of the disability. They should describe an average day before and after the disability or changes in the applicant's daily routine as a result of the disability.


While the above information will increase the chances of having the application for benefits granted, it is more valuable at the hearing level, since most applications are denied.


THE APPEAL PROCESS


While the vast majority of applications are denied, approximately 60 percent of denials which are appealed are reversed at the hearing level. Once the claimant gets the written denial or termination notice (in the case of someone who already receives benefits), that person must file a request for reconsideration with the Social Security office within 60 days. When reconsideration is denied, as usually is the case the claimant has another 60 days to request a hearing before an administrative law judge who will review the application.


At the hearing, the claimant must be prepared to prove, through live or written testimony of doctors and other witnesses, that the impairment severely restricts his or her ability to perform work-related functions and that the claimant, because of age, education and past jobs, cannot engage in substantial gainful activity. If the claimant loses the hearing, that person has the right to appeal to the Social Security Appeals Council and U.S. District Court.


It is advisable to have legal representation at the hearing and, if necessary, beyond. Many lawyers will take cases on a contingency basis, agreeing to take as their fee a percentage of back benefits accrued, usually 25 percent, if they win the case. If the case is lost, the attorney will receive no fee.


The Social Security Act allows claimants and their lawyers to make any fee arrangement, but the final fee must be approved by Social Security before it can be paid. Social Security will withhold and directly pay 25 percent of accrued benefits to the lawyer.

Frank Sato, president of the Japanese American Citizens League (JACL) feels that most Americans look at Japanese Americans with a ""strange dichotomy.""


On one hand, he said, people are losing jobs and blaming it on the trade imbalance between this country and the Pacific Rim nations. On the other hand there is an increasing affinity for Asian culture, with widespread interest in such subjects as sushi and martial arts. In both cases, Sato feels Americans are relating to Americans of Japanese descent for the wrong reasons.


""I don't think the average American understands Japanese culture,"" he said.


Because most Americans do not distinguish between Japanese Americans and Japanese from Japan, he feels the JACL must ""alert and sensitize"" America to the issues and problems currently confronting the national Japanese American community.


JACL, founded in San Francisco in 1929, acts as an educational, human and civil rights organization for Japanese Americans. The group has 114 chapters nationwide and boasts a total of 27,000 members.


Sato serves voluntarily as national JACL president. He works as Inspector General for the Veteran's Administration, serving as one of the highest-ranking Asian American appointees in the Reagan administration. His position allows him to express the concerns of JACL to members of the administration and Congress.


The issues he and JACL advocate strongly for are:


-- Redress: Sato said redress for losses incurred by Japanese Americans during their World War II internment is ""a constitutional issue that needs to be clarified."" Current legislation pending in Congress stipulates that each surviving member of the forced evacuation be awarded $20,000.


Forty-five years after the internment occurred, he said, people ask him, ""Why bring it up now?""


Sato replies that 10 percent of the population knows that the internment took place. And 69 to 70 percent of the population was not even born prior to 1942. History books, Sato added, say nothing about the internment and need to accurately describe the incident. But he feels that passage of redress legislation is going to be a ""tough, tough, tough battle.""


""It's not an issue of $20,000,"" Safo said. ""It's an educational issue -- to make sure that it will never happen again.""


-- Development of leaders: Studies indicate that Asian Americans acquire more education than any other group in the country, yet still lag behind their white counterparts in income. Sato attributes this to the lack of Asian and Japanese Americans in leadership positions.


""How many Asian American heads of corporations do you know of?"" he asked. ""Right now, we're just knocking at the door. There are four Japanese American members of Congress. We're doing very well locally, but not nationally. There needs to be a leadership push.""


-- Nisei aging and retirement: One JACL goal is ""to promote the rich heritage of our people,"" Sato said. ""We are born into that heritage, some try and escape it during adulthood, then revert back to it when they get older. It's a full circle back to their heritage.""


Sato notes that, as the majority of the Nisei quickly approach retirement age, more programs will be required to deal with their aging. The JACL has established an aging and retirement program to examine and implement further support programs.


-- Out-marriage: At a recent JACL-sponsored conference in Fresno on the topic of bi-racial marriages, Sato said, one sansei described an incident concerning his Caucasian wife and bi-racial son. At a supermarket, a woman noticed the son, then said to the wife, ""How could you marry somebody like that?""


""There needs to be more support for biracial families,"" Sato said.


-- Building coalitions: World War II pitted the Japanese and Chinese against each other, here and abroad, with the Chinese making their ethnicity clear so they would not be mistaken for Japanese.


Sato recalled that newly-elected Los Angeles City Councilman Mike Woo recently visited him and the Japanese American members of Congress while in Washington D.C.


""Up until 10 or 15 years ago, the Chinese and the Japanese in this country didn't have much to do with each other,"" Sato said. ""We need to work on building strong ties.""


-- Anti-Asian American violence: In 1985, JACL compiled a report on violent crimes against Asian Americans and distributed the study to every member of Congress. The report sought to expose the magnitude of the problem, and included a chronological listing of violent crimes against Asian Americans since 1981.


The JACL also used the report to educate and sensitize the media on their portrayals of Asians. Sato cited an incident where General Motors used an advertisement that stated. ""Get your Jap-zappers here.""


At the same time, Congressman Norm Mineta has recently introduced a ""hate crime"" bill that would require law enforcement agencies to record and prosecute racially-motivated crimes.


Sato noted parallels between current anti-Asian sentiment and the mood in the country prior to World War II.


""The biggest act of anti-Asian American violence occurred in 1942,"" Sato said. ""Unless people blow the whistle right when it happens, there's going to be a lot more of this nonsense. We must alert and sensitize others and bring it to a head. Don't let people . . . with it. That's the basis of citizenship -- to bring it to a forefront.""


Sato sees a positive trend developing despite the ominous challenges facing Asian and Japanese Americans.


""Our young people are seeing the rightful place of the Japanese Americans,"" he said. ""We are in the throes of greater contributions. If only I could push our people a little more.""

One could easily assume that Republican Congressman John Miller has suddenly become an arch conservative, given his recent votes in favor of aid to the Nicaraguan Contras, funding for research on the Strategic Defense Initiatives or ""Star Wars,"" and against the Clean Water Act.


However, as he explains these and other stands, he instead projects the image of a fairly independent politician who generally looks at each issue without being constrained by strict ideology or party line loyalty.


You can tell he loves his work in Congress -- the give and take of Washington, D.C. politics and even the huge tide of constituent requests he and his staff must continuously address. He seems more relaxed and more satisfied than he has been for years.


Miller, a New Yorker by birth, has been around Seattle for at least two decades. He started his career here as a lawyer in private practice, then became an assistant attorney general in state government. Following a stint on the Seattle City Council, he joined KIRO-TV's ranks as a political commentator for three years. The television exposure is believed to have helped him win the election for the open congressional seat in the First District in 1984.


As his campaign for reelection begins to take shape, Miller must increasingly defend his votes on key national and international issues. Miller's major opponent, Democrat Reese I indquist, is pushing hard to challenge Miller's opposition to resolutions supporting the Salt II arms control treaty and the nuclear test ban, his support for Contra aid, and his positions on domestic budget decisions and defense spending.


Both Miller and Lindquist seek to represent the First District, an area whose boundaries run from Magnolia and Laurelhurst to Kirkland the Kitsap Peninsula and the southernmost part of Snohomish County.


Issues which will be high on the Miller campaign agenda are:


Federal deficit reduction. In an attempt to reduce the federal budget deficit, Miller looked at the 1987 budget resolution program by program. Thus, he ended up voting against the Clean Water Act, a measure that would have allowed for a 76 percent increase in appropriations for water quality projects across the country.


According to Miller, ""If you're trying to hold the line (on spending) across the board, you cannot say one day you're reducing the deficit, and the next day vote for a 76 percent increase on a budget item.""


Miller supported the Gramm-Rudman law which establishes automatic, across-the-board spending cuts to meet deficit reduction targets until 1991. And he says he will support revisions to bring the law in line with the Supreme Court decision which found that part of the law violated the Constitution by giving the legislative branch too much authority. To comply with the court's ruling, the Senate last week voted to move the authority for the spending cuts to the Office of Management and Budget.


Contra aid in Nicaragua. In explaining his reasons for this vote, largely unpopular in the Seattle area, Miller argues that the Sandinista government in Nicaragua has retreated from its promise to be a nonaligned government. Instead, he sees an ever-growing Soviet and Cuban presence there, a belief shared by an increasing number of Miller's colleagues on Capitol Hill.


He defends his vote for $100 million in Contra aid by saying, ""Diplomacy, to be effective, has to have some teeth. Our aim is to get the Sandinista government to live up to its original commitment. There are 1,000 peasants a month streaming into the Contra camps."" Miller, obviously very concerned about human rights violations in Nicaragua, says the Catholic bishops have expressed concerns about the Sandinista government's actions.


Miller says there must be a bipartisan approach to foreign policy consistent with U.S. ideals and national interest. ""When there is a Republican administration, we tend to look away from the abuses of the totalitarian right,"" he said. ""When there is a Democratic administration, the abuses of left-leaning foreign governments are ignored."" The U.S., he believes, would benefit from a foreign policy consistent with democratic ideals. Nations that are more democratic tend to do better economically and are friendlier to the U.S. ""It's been demonstrated across the world, without exception, that people aspire to democratic values,"" he says.


On other foreign policy issues, Miller opposed the now-deposed Marcos government in the Philippines and the Botha regime in South Africa. With Congressman William Gray (D-PA), he sponsored an anti-apartheid bill earlier this year. The bill evolved in stronger form as the Dellums amendment (Ron Dellums, D-CA) which subsequently passed the House.


Defense spending. Miller supported the 1987 House budget resolution which included reductions in defense spending. And he is anxious to see changes in the present system of military procurement.


Curiously, although he voted for an appropriation on research funding for the Strategic Defense Initiatives, he voted against money for the MX Missile. The Reagan administration regards both systems as critical bargaining chips in its arms control negotiations with the Soviets. Although the administration exerted strong pressure on Miller to support funding for the MX, the freshman congressman steadfastly maintained his position.


Miller recently co-sponsored a bill requiring safety regulations for fishing vessels. And as a response to the growing crisis in liability incurance costs, he will be looking at measures to make it easier for small and medium sized businesses to self-insure.


Recent publicity surrounding the platform of the State Republican Party prompted a question about Miller's compatibility with its many controversial positions. Throughout his political career, he has embraced generally liberal to moderate positions on many issues. For instance, he has favored measures to oppose discriminatory practices, and has supported the Equal Rights Amendment and abortion rights.


Without a pause, he says, ""I didn't agree with the Republican platform two years ago and I don't today. However, I don't ignore it; I read it."" He has been willing to explain to others where he differs and why. Miller doesn't believe many politicians strictly follow party platforms, anyway.


As a Seattle City Council member for eight years, Miller was instrumental in supporting the preservation and development of the International District. ""My major contribution, along with others, was to help the City rediscover the ID -- that the ID was a crucial part of Seattle,"" he says. He worked to plant the seeds for improvements in the area and set up working relationships between City government and District residents and business persons.


Miller has been a longtime supporter of redress for Japanese Americans interned during World War II. He is one of 135 cosponsors of HR442, presently before Congress.


Miller's campaign staff members hope to raise $500,000 to cover the costs of the campaign. Most of the funds will be used to pay for media costs. The staff also plans to organize phone banks and doorbelling efforts. As in the campaign of 1984, the staff is unpaid.


During his first term, Miller has held numerous town meetings which have been well attended and lively. A gregarious man, he enjoys this interaction with his constituents. Meetings like these and mailing privileges are advantages enjoyed by incumbent officeholders.


Slick Miller ads are already being run on television. Miller is an experienced, articulate campaigner, comfortable in this role. His opponent, Reese Lindquist, though new to this game of politics, is also articulate and comfortable in his new role. (Of course, as former president of the Seattle Teachers Association and the Washington Education Association, Lindquist is no stranger to politics.)


There are major differences between the two candidates. Lindquist appears to be consistently liberal. Miller, on the other hand, is sometimes liberal, sometimes moderate and sometimes conservative. This appears to be an issue-oriented campaign, which will make it one of the more interesting ones to watch.

President Corazon C. Aquino is scheduled to make a historic visit to the United States from September 15 to 23 -- her first since the popular February uprising and military revolt in the Philippines. Aquino will meet with U.S. President Ronald Reagan, American bankers and the North American Filipino community. She will also address the United Nations and the U.S. Congress. Her itinerary includes the cities of New York, Washington, D.C., Boston and San Francisco.


The Filipino community in the U.S. eagerly awaits the visit of the popular president. For many Filipinos abroad, as for their compatriots back home, Aquino has come to personify the freedom that Filipinos bravely struggled for during the years of the Marcos dictatorship.


If celebration is the prevailing atmosphere of Aquino's visit to the U.S., caution will pervade her dealings with the U.S. officials and bankers. One reason for Aquino's visit is to emphasize to Reagan, who has reluctantly recognized her authority and distrusts some of her progressive policies, that she is in control of the government.


For its part, the White House will probably press her to give a firm guarantee of tenure for the U.S. bases, and push her to take a hardline military solution to the problem of insurgency.


The insurgency will certainly be one of the top subjects on the U.S. agenda. Both Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and Secretary of State George Shultz have made no secret of their disagreement with Aquino's policy of reconciliation with the New People's Army (NPA) and the National Democratic Front (NDF). On this issue, U.S. officials find themselves in unity with Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile's position that there is no possible solution to the insurgency other than a military solution.


Armed Forces Chief of Staff General Fidel Ramos, commenting on Aquino's willingness to conduct ceasefire negotiations with the NDF, blamed ""the prevailing atmosphere and the new administration's magnanimity"" for the continuing expansion of the NPA. Richard Armitage, deputy assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs, said that the NPA actions ""leave little doubt in our mind that, at the end of the day, military action will be required to defeat the insurgency.""


Thus, the U.S. regards Enrile and Ramos as necessary to check the progressive moves of the new Aquino government. As Undersecretary of State Michael Armacost told the Foreign Service Institute last April 23, ""Enrile and Ramos are important as a bridge between the old order and the new to help contain excessive zeal in the new government's dealing with the past.""


In the economic field, the U.S. will no doubt push Aquino to continue the so-called ""structural reforms"" and ""austerity programs"" prescribed by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. In the past, these economic development policies have made the Philippine economy subservient to U.S. economic and banking interests. Already, the U.S. has found a valuable ally in Finance Minister Jaime Ongpin who has agreed to repay all of the country's $26 billion debt on the onerous terms demanded by the banks. He has also brought down barriers to foreign imports which are currently protecting Filipino business from unfair competition from multinationals.


The success of Aquino's visit will depend on how she will tackle the problems of the Philippine military and economy. While the U.S. has legitimate interests in the Philippines, the rights and interests of the Filipinos must have primacy over these. Aquino's strength in dealing with the U.S. comes from the fact that her presidency was the result of a people's determination -- or people's power -- to end a much hated U.S.-sponsored regime. This is what makes Aquino different from previous Philippine presidents. She does not owe the U.S. any political debt.


Because of strong U.S. support of the regressive factions in the government against the initiatives of Aquino and the progressive elements in her cabinet, it is necessary that Filipinos and their American friends support Aquino in her progressive moves. Aquino's program of democratization can only be realized if the Philippines is freed from U.S. economic and military domination.

Five thousand Filipino Americans from New York and outlying states gathered in the Bronx on September 21 to greet Philippine President Corazon Aquino during her recent visit to the United States.


Aquino's visit to the U.S. was her first since the popular February revolution that ousted Ferdinand Marcos from power and swept her into the presidency. Her itinerary also included: a brief stop at the house in Newton, Mass. where she formerly lived with her husband Benigno Aquino, Jr., a visit with President Reagan, and addresses to the U.S. Congress and the United Nations.


President Aquino received an honorary degree from Fordham University and addressed a people's rally gathered on a soccer field-size lawn.


When the crowd discovered that President Aquino had arrived, loud applause and shouts of ""Cory!"" drowned out a singing quartet's performance. Many in the crowd wore Aquino's yellow insignia color, flashed the ""V"" for victory sign and waved flags and banners. Tinikling dancers, part of the local Filipino cultural program, rushed on and quickly ended their performance.


""I feel like I am at a rally in the Philippines,"" said Aquino in Tagalog, the predominant language of the Philippines.


A Filipina friend, who interpreted for me, said Aquino spoke in ""simple"" Tagalog, using a language understandable even to an illiterate. ""She spoke like a mother,"" she said, impressed.


Joseph A. O'Hare, president of Fordham University, a Jesuit school, presented the honorary doctorate of law degree to President Aquino, whom he called a woman of ""remarkable grace in all its meaning, including its theological one.""


""But most important, she has that generosity of spirit to bind up the wounds of her people,"" O'Hare said.


President Aquino, bespectacled and wearing a burgundy university gown, said she accepted the award ""in the name of the Philippine people.""


""In the past, I was told people in New York were embarrassed to admit they were Filipino under my predecessor,"" she said. ""Now you loudly proclaim you are Filipinos."" The crowd, many of whom came in family groups, cheered.


Corazon Cojuangco Aquino now joins four past presidents of the Philippines who have their names engraved on the steps of the Terrace of Presidents on the Rosehill Campus, where the ceremony was held.


""Her predecessor is conspicuously absent,"" said O'Hare, who did not name former President Ferdinand Marcos, now exiled in Hawaii.


""Things cannot happen without God knowing it and planning it,"" said Aquino, who was forced into a political role after the assassination of her husband, Benigno.


""The Philippines is worth dying for,"" she said, ending her speech.

The U.S. Department of Justice decided on September 19 to retry Ronald Eb. is for the June, 1982 bludgeoning death of Vincent Chin in Detroit.


The decision, announced by Assistant Attorney General William Bradford Reynolds, came shortly after nationwide protests by Asian Americans over the September 11 reversal of Ebens's 1984 conviction by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. The court ruled that Ebens had not received a fair trial.


In June, 1984, a federal jury found Ebens guilty of beating the Chinese American engineer to death with a baseball bat because of racial prejudice. Ebens received a sentence of 25 years to life, but has been out on appeal since his sentencing.


James Shimomura, president of American Citizens for Justice (ACJ), said he was pleased by the ""very rapid fashion"" in which the decision was made. ACJ, a Detroit-based Asian American community coalition, was formed in response to Chin's murder. Shimomura said his group plans to monitor the trial, expected to begin early next year.


Vandals punctured tires on more that 20 automobiles belonging to Southeast Asians in Tacoma, according to the Tacoma News Tribune.


This was the latest incident in a pattern of racially-motivated attacks against Asians. Spokespersons for the police and the Asian community said that it is time for the two groups to resume talks on preventing victimization of Asian refugees.


Tacoma Police patrolman Steve McKinney, one of the officers investigating the case, said he is convinced the attacks were not random. All of the car owners were Asian except for two, who were probably vandalized by mistake.


""This happens about twice a year,"" said McKinney. Asians, he said, ""get tires slashed, people break out their windows -- drive by and shoot them with BB guns. And when they puncture tires, they don't just do one tire, so it could be replaced by a spare. They get three or four.""


One victim, 40-year-old Peun Desome, a Laotian refugee, said she is now worried about living in the neighborhood with her four children.


Bob Yamashita, executive director of Tacoma Community House, which provides social services to Southeast Asian refugees, said there have been meetings with both Tacoma police and the Pierce County Sheriff's Office to discuss problems between Asians and other groups and between Asians and police. The results have been positive, but temporary, said Yamashita.


Still, Yamashita said he is encouraged by the recent decision by city officals to form a citizens committee on police-minority relations in wake of the police shooting of Henry Allen Burley.


In response to widespread protests over his remarks about Blacks and Hispanics, Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone issued an apology to Congress and the Reagan administration, but did not retract his statements.


The controversy began September 22 when Nakasone told a study session of his political party that the literacy level in the U.S. is lower than that of Japan because Japan is a homogeneous society. He attributed the low literacy level to the large number of Blacks, Puerto Ricans and Mexicans in the U.S.


Although Japanese newspapers and government officials disagree on whether Nakasone was referring to the intelligence level or the literacy level of these groups in America, critics were still outraged.


Black, Hispanic and Asian American groups have condemned Nakasone's racist statements, and in some communities, boycotts of Japanese goods and other acts of reprisal have been organized.


The incident has also brought forth charges of unfair hiring practices by Japanese corporations in the U.S., as well as documentation of racism in Japanese society, where minorities are treated as second-class citizens in nearly every aspect of life.


This summer, Stanford University awarded $54,000, reportedly its largest settlement ever, to professor Diana Paul as a result of a discrimination suit, according to Asian Week.


Paul, who is part-Japanese American, sued for sexual and racial discrimination because she was denied tenure two years ago in the religious studies department. The University dismissed her formal grievance at entry level, and an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ruling was pending when she filed suit.


Paul claimed that professors in her department displayed racist and sexist attitudes. She accused them of questioning the capacity of what they called the ""yellow race"" for religious studies, of mimicking the confusion of the consonants ""I"" and ""r,"" and of other derogatory remarks.


The department has never bestowed a doctorate on any Asian student, Paul said, although sometimes as many as two of its six graduate students have been Asian.


Stanford had no comment on her allegations.


Paul and her attorney attributed the University's decision to settle to an incriminking deposition by religious studies department head Van Harvey. According to Paul, Harvey admitted that he had a psychological obsession with her, which he was undergoing therapy to cure, and that he had described her body to students in a class he was teaching.


Paul is now pursuing a career as a consultant to businesses that trade with Japan.

The soldiers, sailors and airmen in Vietnam referred to home as ""The World."" Doug Luna returned to The World in 1966 and found nobody ordering him around. He landed a job in the warehouse of Frederick & Nelson six days after coming back. Luna considered himself lucky, since the company also financed his undergraduate college education and a year of law school.


His self-survival reflexes did not easily diminish. When he woke up in the morning, he wondered why there was no shooting going on. He found it difficult to sit with his back to a door. He developed a bad rash over his body, which the doctor diagnosed as a case of nerves.


But Luna said he would have thought less of himself if he had not gone to Vietnam. He had become a professional. Now, he is an attorney for the Tulalip Tribes and the Washington State Commission on Asian American Affairs. He sees a similarity between most judges and attorneys who are Vietnam veterans: they are pros at what they do. They offer to settle a case. If it's not accepted, Luna said, they ""will take you all the way.""


""In hand-to-hand combat, you're supposed to take out the other person in the first 15 seconds,"" he said. ""That's not that good -- you should take him out in eight. Do what we tell you or suffer the consequences.""


Luna handled a discrimination case against a construction company in Alaska. The company refused to resolve the case as Luna proposed; he obtained a court injunction and temporarily shut the company down.


Conversely, Luna also knows Vietnam veteran attorneys who often engage in pro bono work -- offering legal expertise for free -- and raise funds for worthwhile causes. A former chopper pilot, working with a major national bonding company, raised over one million dollars in corporate contributions for a Vietnam veteran's memorial in New York.


""Veterans are very honest in their feelings,"" Luna said. ""They will help you out if they want to, and they won't if they don't want to.""


Vietnam, he said, was like being in prison, and he now appreciates the things he was cut off from. After his time in country, he gained more respect for other people and more respect for women.


""I appreciate the interaction more and appreciate basic friendships,"" he said. ""It's a great thing to be able to talk to a woman, not just to obtain sex, but just because she is a woman.""


Larry Wong left Vietnam in September, 1969, but still had seven months left to serve in the Marine Corps. He got out of 'Nam a month-and-a-half early for his father's funeral and was happy to again have clean ceramic bathrooms and clean air. He also didn't have to worry about jumping out of bed and running for a bunker. Stateside, the Corps assigned him to the Lighter Than Air (LTA) blimp and helicopter base in Southern California.


By that time, he had already made up his mind to fight a system which produced ""death and destruction that is not good for anybody, not even the people that want it."" During an inspection, he pulled wrinkled dungarees out of a duffel bag and wore unshined brass. Wong's superiors punished him with messman's duty. He worked 14 to 16 hours a day on mess duty, from five in the morning until nine or 10 at night.


The Corps later reassigned Wong to grounds clean-up, then he got out of the service and into Boeing, where he had worked before joining the Marines. The company was obligated to offer him his job back when he returned. He cleaned airplane parts in acid vats for four months, until the company seemed like a large machine just like the Marine Corps.


Wong went to work as a waiter for numerous Seattle restaurants. At the Washington Plaza Hotel, now the Westin, he was promoted to room service captain, then to restaurant manager. He experienced a ""choking feeling,"" caught between the workers and executive management, and knew he had to get out.


Management took him out for coffee and said, ""Larry, you just started. Why are you leaving?""


""I can't explain it,"" Wong replied, ""other than I gotta leave in order to live -- to survive.""


Wong next drove a delivery truck for Frito Lay, a job he enjoyed because he got to be his own boss on the road. At the same time, he acted in productions staged by the Theatrical Ensemble of Asians, the early '70s forerunner to Northwest Asian American Theatre (NWAAT). The service left him with a sour taste for the regimen of sports, and the stage provided a means to express himself.


""In the service, you don't express yourself,"" he said. ""You just take orders and do what you're told.""


Wong left for Hawaii in 1977. He had been there previously on a vacation and thought the islands felt like home, ""comfortable on a subconscious level."" He left Seattle on Thursday, and by Tuesday, he managed a restaurant for the Hilton Hawaiian Village. Other jobs in Hawaii included managing fast food restaurants and selling copiers. He fell in love, led a simple but satisfactory life, then the bottom fell out in 1980.


Suppressed grief and stress finally came through ""like a pressure cooker,"" he said. He became engaged to his girlfriend, then threw the relationship away.


""I was suppressing all that negative that I absorbed from in-country,"" Wong said. There was grief for participation in a situation that did a lot of destruction, of not only an Asian culture, but here in America, too.


""In the service, I was 19-years-old, going on 14, as far as maturity level and understanding things in life. I didn't want her to get near; I couldn't communicate with her. What I am saying now, I could have never said back then. I would just look or make a joke or try to circumvent it somehow.""


For Wong, that was the last straw. He returned to Seattle and sought help at the Veterans Center. They told him he was experiencing delayed stress.


""If I got into a stressful situation, it was like a fight or flee situation,"" he said. ""And, in modern society, you don't go around fighting people all the time, so it was better for me just to leave job situations and relationship situations.""


Wong credited the Vietnam veteran ""rap groups"" for allowing him and other veterans to ""vent the internal rage that outside in society you can't vent.""


""It was a safe place to express how I felt,"" he said. ""The Veterans Administration was smart enough not to have the Vietnam vet go up to their big, bureaucratic building. That's what they were trying to get away from.""


In 1983, Wong returned to Hawaii, still searching for himself and needing to grow. He figured he was happy there before and decided to give the place a second shot. Staying 10 months, he participated in vets' rap groups and joined the Mormon Church, which he considered health- and family-oriented -- ""all the things I feel are important to me."" At the same time, he lived at a Tibetan Buddhist retreat and felt like he couldn't go back to work because he would be ""going back to a system that was suppressing people.""


""I don't like the idea of being used in the war,"" he said. ""I don't like what we did over there. I can look at it now and say I was just a product of the time. Now, I can say it is a new time, a new age. But it's happening again in Central America. We're a society that seems bent on doing it again with an animalistic instinct to glorify death in the name of some cause.


""War is not healthy; it's not profitable. There's nothing good about it that has any socially redeeming values, unless somebody's banging on your own front door.""


Wong felt he might have been punishing himself back in Hawaii. He couldn't work for restaurants because they sold a lot of sugar desserts that he believed were bad for people. Now, he's looking for work, possibly in a health food store or vegetarian store.


""I'm now trying to be a productive member of society and looking forward to it with a great amount of anticipation,"" he said. ""I look at it like half a cup full of tea, rather than half a cup empty. Peace on earth begins from within.""


Gary Ikeda, now a secretary for Metro's Downtown Seattle Transit Project, remembers coming back home and being a little anxious after reading about the war protests while he was in-country. He came from a job where he knew what he was doing to a situation where he didn't have a job. He saw his father going off to work in the mornings and his younger brother going off to school. Ikeda got unemployment, visited friends and bet at the race-track.


""After the welcome wore off, which didn't take that long,"" he said, ""my family must've thought, 'Who's this bum sitting around here? When's he gonna start doing something?' There were several months doing nothing. I didn't think about Vietnam after I got back. I came back around Christmas time and Christmas in Vietnam was no big deal.""


Mike Higashi realized nobody was ordering him around anymore and he had to do what he wanted to do. He went back to the University of Washington, where students called him and other vets ""baby killers."" His former friends were married and off on their own. Higashi made a whole new set of friends, which included Vietnam vets.


""I became more independent and didn't need people to stroke my ego to make me feel secure,"" he said. ""When I first went to school, I hung around the HUB and we fed off each other as far as what we were going to do. I didn't need that stuff. I cam back to school, had a goal and studied a lot.


""I have Vietnamese patients now,"" said Higashi, now a dentist with his own practice in the International District. ""Back then, I would have never predicted that I would see Vietnamese patients in the U.S. I can empathize with them. When they say they were in Vietnam, I can picture what they're talking about. I can see the dirt roads. The advertisements on Jackson Street are the same style. I see the Vietnamese signs down here, and it's like deja vu.""


""You expect them to be selling warm cans of Coke outside for two bucks,"" Ikeda said. ""It's not a knock on them. It was the only way to make money. It was a poor country.""


In 1970, Don Woo left Vietnam and the Marines. He sought out a friend in Las Vegas, hawked his pistol and worked odd jobs. Then the money ran out.


Woo had been a Marine in Vietnam for seven years and soldiering was what he was good at. He could have extended his tour in Vietnam for another six months at a time, but he had been through enough of that conflict.


""Some said we were there to stop the spread of communism, but we didn't have anything at stake,"" Woo said. ""There was absolutely no threat whatsoever of the Cong or the NVA coming to the U.S. shores. There was no incentive. It was just a job.""


Because it was just a job, Woo tried to find more military work. He heard somebody was recruiting mercenaries in El Paso, Texas for the war between British Honduras and El Salvador. Other veteran friends received letters inviting them back to Vietnam as civilians to make civilian money. Woo figured the recruiting office must have known the contact person for such work, since somebody knew when a G.I. left the service and knew how to reach him.


At one recruiting office, the sergeant asked Woo, ""What was it that you were looking for?""


""Mercenary work,"" Woo answered.


Woo said he saw everybody's head turn in that office like in the ad, ""When E.F. Hutton speaks, everybody listens.""


""They looked at me real funny, like I said a dirty word,"" Woo said.


""We don't know anything about that,"" the recruiting sergeant sternly replied. ""If you wanna join the Army, we can fix you up.""


Woo passed a postal exam in Las Vegas, but couldn't get a job. A job counselor advised him that unemployment looked even worse in Seattle and told him to stay in Las Vegas. ""What is your specialty?"" she asked. ""Marine Corps,"" Woo answered. ""We don't have a classification for you, but we'll put one together.""


Woo received the classification in the mail -- detective. The counselor figured that an ex-Marine would be proficient in being observant and quiet, and experienced in stealth and surveillance.


Woo, returning to Seattle, hoped to become a commercial diver or work in heavy construction. Both required training and money to go to school. He enrolled in Seattle City College to receive the G.I. Bill and worked part-time as a janitor, then worked for the Seattle Public Schools' gardening crew during the summer, and as a janitor in the winter. Beebe Brothers, an industrial parts company, offered him a job as an assembler. Woo felt he was hired because they needed a ""token disabled veteran."" He is now a machinist for General Electric.


""I wouldn't want to give up that Vietnam experience, unless it could be substituted by a similar experience,"" he said. ""Being close to getting killed is kind of an awakening experience and makes you appreciate what you got. It's like getting out of jail. You look around and say, 'I took all of this for granted.'""


Shox Tokita came back to the states and the comforts he hadn't seen for a while. In Vietnam, he couldn't drink water out of the tap, had to haul in water, had to take showers on the first floor because water pressure didn't exist on the second floor, and used latrine ditches as toilets.


The Air Force assigned him to Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, where he participated in research and development of air armaments. Going to school off the base, he earned a degree in engineering and a masters in business. In 1978, Tokita retired with the rank of full colonel after 24 years in the military.


""I can't put a value on it,"" he said, ""to have been able to mix with different types of people and go to different places in the world, and to experience things outside my immediate environment -- to know what it's like out there.""


South Vietnam fell to the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces in April, 1975. Tokita said he knew it was going to happen.


""I could see that happening as I left,"" he said. ""All the resources and people that we wasted. Most of the other guys knew that. It's a shame. I don't want to see that happen again. If we're going to go in, it has to be to win. War is not a game that you compromise on, as far as I'm concerned.


""I think there's a lot of caution about what we did last time and how we do things. Personally, I think Reagan is on the right track to build up our ability to command our desires in the world, but that's a military guy speaking. We should reach a parity with Russia and trim down each others' advantages -- not spend so much on defense, but spend it on what the countries need.""


""I was disappointed that we just threw our hands in the air and said, 'Fuck it,'"" Woo said. ""In one sense, I didn't really care because I had done my part. I had done what I was asked to do, and we had done it with one hand behind our back. My attitude became, 'Somebody stuck me in this war, and I'm gonna try to just get out of it alive.' I haven't heard absolutely anybody say, 'I'm doing this for my country.'""


""When it happened, it didn't bother me because it was another time, another place so long ago,"" Higashi said.


""I knew it was going to happen,"" Ikeda said. ""I empathized with the other guys. They finally got the hell out of there, instead of beating their heads against the wall.""


""By 1965 and 1966, I knew we did not have the hearts and minds of the people,"" Luna said. ""The ARVN would not come to the aid of a unit even though they were 200 yards away. It was just a matter of time.


""I cried when Vietnam fell because it was a waste. I felt so helpless, there was nothing I could do. When we saw our first article on an anti-war demonstration back there, that really shook us. We always thought our country was behind us. Back here, I could not participate in a pro-war or anti-war movement -- I lost too many friends in the war.""


Jose Velasquez left for Florida after coming back in 1969. Out there, his friend George Fernando called him up and asked how things were going. ""I'm the only Filipino guy around here,"" Velasquez said. George invited Jose to stay with him in San Francisco. Velasquez packed up and left Florida. He attended a city college in San Francisco and felt more comfortable in a cohesive Filipino community. He and George never talked about Vietnam.


Velasquez wishes that the Vietnam veterans had received the same reception as the servicemen returning from World War II. But nobody welcomed the Vietnam vets back, and that is the biggest problem they have, he said. Now, he feels, that's changing as the generations change, with high school kids screaming their heads off at Vietnam vet parades.


""The protest generation protested anything that our government did,"" Velasquez said. ""Our involvement in Vietnam needed to be protested, but they carried it over a little too much. They should have made the government the heavy. Instead, they made returning soldiers the heavies. These guys were the same age as you, grew up with you, but called you 'baby killers.' They don't ask if you were a part of this or that; they generalized.


""Vets didn't really mean to shoot children, but it's one of those things when you wanna come back alive.""


Velasquez heard how the VC booby-trapped babies. A hootch burned, a baby cried, a G.I. ran into the burning hootch to rescue the baby, the baby blew up.


""What if they were in this position?"" Velasquez asked. ""It's funny how our very own generation were the ones that really came out against us. They still don't understand us. But the '80s generation is very open and they wanna know. They believe that we were wronged.


""I don't know if it was right or wrong. Only thing I know is some of us had problems when we came back.""


Tim Hume, counselor at the Seattle Veterans' Action Center said, ""There is an appalling number of vets who have never said a word about Vietnam since they have returned, except maybe when they're drunk. Some have never said a word about it to their families.""


There is a lack of information from World War II about what war really does to people, he said. The cycle is repeated when vets do not tell their children. ""And to see us repeat that cycle is a great American tragedy,"" he said.


According to Hume, there is a misconception that World War II veterans came out of the war okay. One study revealed that 50 percent of World War II veterans are still undergoing post-traumatic stress, where the feeling of being overwhelmed by a life-and-death situation lingers on after the actual combat experience. Thirty-five percent of all World War II veterans are still having war-related nightmares, according to the study.


But there are major differences between the World War II veteran and the Vietnam veteran, Hume explained, The average age of the World War II serviceman was 26. Most had jobs, were married or had established steady relationships before going to war. They were guaranteed their jobs when they returned. The post-war economy was booming, the World War II veteran was generally well-respected, and movies about the subject, like ""Best Years of Our Lives,"" reinforced that respect.


Hume said the servicemen in Vietnam ""were still children, in effect."" Very few had steady jobs before going over, very few were married, and they received 10 times more ""Dear John"" letters than all the American wars combined because the relationships had not matured. When they did return, the American economy was at a recent all-time low and employment was scarce. Women had entered the workforce and competed for jobs. Traditional values had changed during their absence.


""During Victnam, we devalued our youth,"" Hume said. ""We had taken the youth of America and said, 'You are no longer worth anything to us. You are the ones we are going to send off to get killed -- you are expendable.' We took a person not able to vote, sent him off to war, then blamed him for the war. Then we guaranteed problems by not supporting him when he came back.""


Velasquez, now a printer for Minuteman Press in Kent, is active with the Vietnam Veterans of America (VVA). He had previously avoided other veterans and avoided talking about Vietnam until he visited the facsimile of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C., on display at the Seattle Center in 1984.


""If there's anybody you can talk to and who will understand you -- not necessarily understand what you went through, but understand you as a person -- then it is your family, because they are very good listeners,"" Velasquez said. ""It puts you in a spot to answer, and things come out that you've been holding back in. My wife helped me out a lot. I would scare her when I would jump out of bed. She never pushed me to talk about it, but just waited until I finally did. I talk to her more than I do to anybody else.""


Don Woo said he avoids other vets and feels the vets who are most active in vets organizations usually ""have had the least amount of trigger time.""


""It would have been nice if people had a different attitude when we got back,"" Woo said. ""But I don't feel there's anything I wanna be recognized for. There's a few vets that I met and like, but it's not because they're vets or that we met as vets.""


""I tell my son that Vietnam existed,"" Velasquez said. ""The war was there, the killing was there. That's what war is all about. I did enjoy what I was doing because I wasn't out there doing the killing. I had one week missions, then stayed back for a week. I never really got involved. Other people are out there if you want to know more about it. They are ready to talk about it.""


""There was a time when we didn't want to be associated with it,"" Higashi said. ""Now, the country is beginning to realize that it wasn't our fault. People are finally coming around now.""


Higashi and Gary Ikeda hope to someday visit the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C. Ikeda had considered submitting a design for the memorial while studying architecture.


Today, Doug Luna peruses through photographs of himself in Vietnam and notices that he didn't smile anymore as his time in-country progressed. During a trip to Washington, D.C., Luna took his time and walked over to the memorial, he said, to ""psych himself up to see it."" He saw his stepbrother's name embedded in the stone, but the names of some of his friends were missing.


""You have a certain amount of guilt when somebody buys it, because you feel guilty over being alive,"" he said.


Jose Velasquez saw the memorial with other Vietnam veterans. He remembers that they consoled another veteran who wept in front of the memorial because he had helped dump Agent Orange over the Vietnamese countryside. ""It's not your fault,"" they told him. Velasquez also visited the Pentagon, dressed in jeans and a T-shirt that identified him as a Vietnam veteran. A spit and-polish officer passed by and saluted Velasquez. ""Welcome home, soldier,"" the officer said.


""We were there, and we deserve to be recognized,"" Velasquez said.

On October 7, five Philippine journalists, visiting the U.S. on a Fulbright Exchange Program Fellowship, stopped in Seattle to talk with a group of 12 local Filipino Americans.


The journalists were: Maria Regina Emilia Jimenez David, a senior writer for Veritas Newsmagazine and author of ""Toward Our Own Image: The Status of Filipino Women in Media""; Chit Estella, reporter for Malaya, covering the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Office of the Vice President; Jess Diaz, senior reporter for the Philippine Star, who has written articles on the deliberations of the Constitutional Commission; Marlen Ronquillo, senior political reporter for the Philippine Daily Inquirer, covering the Constitutional Commission; and Pachico Seares, editor of the Sun Star Daily, and the only journalist from a rural area.


The journalists were on a six-week U.S. tour, sponsored by the U.S. Information Agency. Their itinerary included Chicago, Washington, D.C. and San Francisco. They spent time covering President Aquino's visit to the U.S., and their stops included visits to several large city newspapers, a Pentagon briefing on U.S. military bases and meetings with individuals in the local Filipino American community.


During their visit here, we found the journalists highly articulate, bright, funny and pragmatic. The following are some of the comments they made during a group discussion with the 12 Filipino Americans:


What was the state of the Philippine press with the suppression of free press under Marcos?


Estella: (Now) there is more balance in news coverage -- what with the Philippine Bulletin, Express, Times Journal, etc. During the martial law, there was some courageous opposition to Marcos.


Seares: It was more difficult in the rural areas. Twenty-four journalists got killed or were missing. The lawlessness was higher in the hinterlands. The commanders were not immediately accountable.


Estella: Sometimes, too, the editors would be encouraging to the journalists to pursue a story, and at the last minute, it would be stopped.


What do you think of the U.S. coverage of President Aquino's official visit to the U.S.?


David: The American coverage focused on the U.S. military bases and the communist insurgency. The economic situation was not discussed nor emphasized enough by the U.S. media to the American public.


What are the effects of President Aquino's visit on the Philippines?


Ronquillo: It depends on what Cory does. She is the only Philippine president not chosen by the U.S.


Seares: However, her political inexperience could work against her.


Estella: Neither the rebels nor the U.S. can assume anything about Cory. Cory listens to the people who are very vocal, very verbal.


Seares: The clear positive effect is her growing confidence in leading the country.


How has the media functioned after the February revolution?


Seares: There are less restrictions. We no longer get calls from the (Presidential) Palace.


Estella: The old newspapers are still around -- the Express, Manila Times, Journal, Daily Bulletin. Their problems is (decreasing) circulation.


Ronquillo: But the free press can be revoked. The old laws have not been repealed and the Freedom Constitution has not been adopted.


What do you think will be included in the Freedom Constitution?


Ronquillo: Oh, the issue of the military bases, the term of the president. The Commission is proposing a one-time, six-year term. It's enough for a good president and it's too long for a bad one. We will also pursue a bicameral body similar to your Senate and House of Representatives. There is a resolution for presidential recall, but since it is only a one-time presidential term, it is difficult to impeach a president.


Hasn't the Philippine media taken up an activist role?


Ronquillo: We are not an activist media. We merely write what we see. Marcos's legacy is that he polarized the press as pro-or anti-Marcos. With the new government, we can abandon the labels.


But there is a sense of activism within the media. We have to struggle to write our story, advocate our own needs because the mainstream press does not include our perspective.


David: That's because you are a minority. We are not the minority in the Philippines. We are very open to views ... The communist National Democratic Front is sold openly in the streets.


Diaz: The Philippine media is evolving to reach a Filipino perspective through the editors, opinions and columnists.


David: The government television channel has cultural presentations that were confined to street protests before. The press displays differing views of developing and developed countries.


We heard stories about how you were treated by the American reporters during the Aquino coverage.


Ronquillo: There were about 20 to 30 (American reporters) who were rude, very rude. When Cory spoke to Congress, they told us that seating was on a first-come, first-serve basis. The Sergeant-At-Arms did not let us in until all the American press were seated. They gave us the back seats . . .


How do Filipinos perceive Americans?


Estella: There is a distinction between American people and American government. When Americans visit, Filipinos feel good. They would still say the post-World War II greeting, ""Hello, Joe, Hi, Jo."" But the American government angered the Filipinos. When Reagan said (election) cheating was on both sides, when he would hedge on the $200 million grant, it came across as if he did not like Cory.


Ms. Magazine did an article on Cory and how the Filipino women's movement supported her. Can you comment on that?


David: Cory was supported not because she was a woman, but because people were against Marcos. Marcos made it a feminist issue when he said that women belong at home. Cory would not identify herself as a feminist in the sense that she is not part of an organization. The media image of a feminist in the Philippines is a woman who is anti-family, pro-abortion ... etc. Right now, there is a lot of discussion that the inclusion of an equality clause in the Constitution is divisive and anti-revolutionary.

Despite a humdrum beginning, the 1986 political season ended on a smashing note with the victory of Democrat Brock Adams, the emergence of Democratic control in the U.S. Senate, and continued Democratic majorities in the U.S. House of Representatives and both houses of the Washington State Legislature.


Locally, Brock Adams's victory over incumbent Republican Slade Gorton was the big story. After a strong showing in the primary, Adams began to generate enthusiasm and campaign money. The hard-hitting political pro also capitalized on Gorton campaign blunders to swing the election his way.


No one questioned the quality of the two candidates. Each is highly respected for intelligent analysis and action on key issues, integrity and knowledge of the governmental process. They are articulate and energetic. And they have established broad networks in the political and economic mainstream of American life.


Adams had less campaign money, but more ""people power."" Gorton had lots and lots of campaign funds, an incumbency, but struggled to overcome charges of ineffectiveness and his identification with a President who appeared disinterested or oblivious to the huge problem Washingtonians had with the siting of a nuclear dump in their state. Adams was especially engaging with his gregarious, warm and upbeat personal style, while Gorton appeared aloof, rather reticent about exposing himself as a caring and friendly individual.


There were questions about each candidate's integrity -- questions about Gorton's ability to keep his word -- such as his reversal on Daniel Manion's controversial judicial appointment after winning the Reagan administration's support for Seattle attorney William Dwyer to another federal judgeship. Gorton, on the other hand, hammered away at Adams's lobbying efforts for Libyan and Japanese interests after his departure from government service.


Adams took 51 percent of the vote, compared to Gorton's 49 percent -- certainly no overwhelming mandate. But because he is familiar with Washington state issues and comfortable with the political structure in Washington D.C., most political observers believe he will be very effective in the U.S. Senate.


Republican incumbent Congressman John Miller defeated Democratic challenger Reese Lindquist in a very close race in the First Congressional District. Unfortunately, the debate between the two men degenerated into discussion only on their substantial differences on Nicaraguan Contra aid. Many observers believe Lindquist is one of the best candidates to surface in Seattle in a long time. His family is exceptional -- wife, Cecile, an articulate, smart and down-to-earth campaigner, has advocated for the developmentally, disabled for 25 years; and sons, Mark and Brian, traveled the campaign trail with their father in an exemplary fashion.


Rod Chandler, the incumbent Republican Congressman from the 8th Congressional District, turned back a strong challenge by Democrat David Giles.


And popular Democratic Congressman Mike Lowry easily defeated challenger Don McDonald in the 7th Congressional District race.


The biggest winner in this year's election season has to be Governor Booth Gardner. He was simply everywhere -- campaigning ardently for Democrats Brock Adams, Reese Lindquist and scores of legislative candidates. At this point in the state's history, his coattails are longer than any other politician -- and even longer than those of a nationally-known Republican leader who came to this state to gain support for an incumbent Republican senator -- who subsequently lost.


Gardner, in his earliest political years, had to be pushed and prodded into campaign activity. But he has today become one of the most energetic, effective and popular campaigners in the state. He is a paradox: on the surface somewhat whimsical and beguiling, but, deep inside, a driven man with strong convictions about peace and justice. This mild-mannered Democratic governor, with a corporate executive style, has become the state's most important political power broker.


To gain acceptance for his 1987 legislative agenda -- tax reform, welfare system changes, water quality projects, reorganization of state government, new revenues for education (Higher Ed and K-12) and other key issues, Gardner needed a Democratic majority in the Legislature. So he worked hard for Democratic candidates throughout the state. Many credit Gardner with swinging voter support to Democrats in close races -- particularly in the 44th where Democrat Rick Bender narrowly defeated Republican Jeanine Long and in Spokane where Democrat Jan Polek, a highly respected candidate, barely squeaked by Republican John Moyer.


On the west side of Lake Washington, all Democratic incumbents won re-election by wide margins. These included Representatives Marlin Applewick, Grace Cole, Ken Jacobsen, June Leonard, Gary Locke, Gene Lux, Dick Nelson, John O'Brien, Nancy Rust and Georgette Valle. Incumbent state senators returning to the Legislature include Senators George Fleming, Ray Moore, Nita Rinehart, Phil Talmadge and Al Williams, Anticipated close races in the 36th and 46th Legislative Districts turned out to be not so close after all -- Democrat Ray Moore easily defeated Republican challenger Don Wollam in the 36th as did Democrat Nita Rinehart in her victory over Seattle School Board member Ellen Roe in the 46th. Some Democrats -- Jim McDermott, Janice Niemi and Jesse Wineberry in the 43rd District, Seth Armstrong and Helen Sommers in the 36th, and Fred Warnke in the 31st -- were unchallenged. Open seats in the 34th and 44th District were filled by Democrats Mike Heavey and Maria Cantwell, respectively.


Eastside Legislative District races were dominated by victories of Republican incumbents, although the vote differences were smaller due to the fine crop of Democratic challengers this year. The winners included Bruce Holland, Mike Patrick and Kent Pullen in the 47th District; Dan McDonald and Paul Sanders in the 48th; Fred May and Joseph Williams in the 41st; and John Betrozoff, Alan Bluechel and Louise Miller in the 45th. Republican Roy Ferguson defeated Democrat Harvey Kriloff for an open seat in the 48th District.


The most predictable state-wide ballot measure, Referendum 40, passed with strong public support. It was a vehicle for voters to express this state's opposition to federal efforts to make Hanford the nation's high-level nuclear dump site. Voters also supported ballot measures to create a citizen commission to set salaries for state officials (HJR 49), to allow for increased authority and membership and a public process for the state's Judicial Commission (SJR 136), and a levy option for new school construction (HJR 55). Rejected were ballot measures which would have increased taxes to protect wildlife (Initiative 90) and to modify procedures to fill legislative and county vacancies between elections (SJR 138).


Locally, voters passed Initiative 30, thus repealing the designation of Seattle as a ""City of Refuge"" for those seeking asylum here. Passage of the initiative also disbands the Seattle Citizens Commission on Central America, forces city employees to cooperate with federal immigration officials and sends a message to city government to remove itself from foreign policy decisions.


King County's Proposition 1 passed, setting the stage for acquisition of an automated fingerprint identification system. County Council member Ron Sims, who represents the 5th District in Seattle, was instrumental in generating support for this measure. The other County ballot issue, Proposition 2, which would have altered the County Charter to establish the County Executive's salary at a level no less than 125 percent of County Council members, failed to receive voter approval.


Asians, particularly Japanese Americans, did not take kindly to the Japan-bashing tone of the Slade Gorton television political ads. And if the final vote is any indication, neither aid the majority of Washington state voters. Clearly, there are other factors to consider in analyzing the lack of voter support for Slade Gorton, but it appears that Washington state voters are generally too well informed and sensitive to be influenced by such negative and demagogic rhetoric.


Ads which insult the intelligence of the prospective voter can work against the candidate who uses this form of advertising to get voter support. In this sense, it is a form of negative political advertising.

The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear an appeal by the Reagan administration to kill a class action lawsuit concerning the internment of 125,000 Japanese Americans during World War II. The court declined to take action on a separate appeal by the Japanese American plaintiffs to broaden the scope of the lawsuit.


The lawsuit, filed in 1983, seeks monetary compensation from the U.S. government for all Japanese Americans forcibly removed from their homes and interned during the war. The original suit listed 22 separate counts of damages suffered, but a court ruling in January, 1986 granted only one count. This ruling was appealed by both sides last August.


The Reagan administration argues that the Japanese American claims are ""plainly without merit"" and were filed too late. If the Supreme Court grants the government's appeal, the lawsuit dies. If it denies the government's appeal, several possibilities remain.


With no further action by the Supreme Court, the case would go back to the lower courts to be heard at trial. The only issue addressed in such a trial would be the government's taking of property without due compensation.


The 19 Japanese American plaintiffs initiated the original class action suit based on government violation of various constitutional and civil rights. They want all 22 counts reinstated before the suit proceeds to trial, and this is the aim of their appeal. So far, however, there is no indication whether the Supreme Court will accept their appeal for a hearing.

State Representative Gary Locke is looking forward to the 50th session of the Washington State legislature with a combination of anticipation and dread.


This is an odd-numbered year, which means the legislature will convene on January, 12 for a minimum of 103 days, as compared to 60 days for the even-numbered years. Covernor Booth Gardner, who has proposed a half-billion dollar tax increase to improve education in this state, will order special sessions and keep the legislature on Olympia until it produces a budget he agrees with.


Locke, a Democrat, will chair the appropriations subcommittee to the House Ways and Means Committee. He will be responsible for assembling, the state's budget and will chair nothing . . . hear . . . and listen to proposals and . . . proposals, he said Locke is sure the . . . will be grueling and has decided to find an apartment in Olympic rather than make the hour-and-15-minute commute back to Seattle every night.


""People seem to have a misconception that legislators attend nothing but parties, receptions and are boozing it up,"" Locke said. ""It's not that way at all.""


The Ways and Means Committee, he said, is responsible for finding ""ways to spend money and the means to raise it."" Major issues facing the legislature this year will be Governor Gardner's campaign to bolster education in this state by channeling $200 million into universities and colleges to curb the faculty ""brain drain""; and water quality programs -- cleaning up Puget Sound, drinking water and toxic hot-spots.


""People want money for different programs,"" he said. ""Any legislative policy is of little consequence if you don't have the money for it. I'm excited by the challenge of chairing the subcommittee, but there is also a heavy responsibility to address the needs and demands down there. A lot of people and institutions are neglected.""


Among the needs Locke hopes to address are senior citizens' services, wages and benefits for nursing home employees and care for the mentally ill.


Last fall, Locke easily won re-election to a third term as representative of the 37th District, which encompasses most of southeast Seattle. In his past four years as a representative, he has sponsored or been instrumental in the passage of the following legislation; benefits for crime victims, punishment for marital rape, funding for the Commission on Asian American Affairs, redress payments for Japanese American school employees fired during World War II, free fishing licenses for the developmentally disabled, authorization for civil rights agencies to award damages for pain and suffering, finding for the new Wing Luke Asian Museum, and $700,000 to renovate the Mt. Baker Apartments where many Southeast Asian refugees reside.


This legislative session. Locke will sponsor legislation affecting the International District, including a bill that will require stores selling fortified wine to obtain special licenses and a bill to cut welfare payments to alcoholics.


Locke, a former trial lawyer with the King County Prosecutor's Office, currently works as an attorney for Pacific Northwest Bell. At a current annual salary of $14,500, most legislators maintain other jobs.


""It's never an issue of pay, Locke said. ""It's more to have an impact on the future and direction of the state, to shape discussion on the issues and fund solutions.""


Locke received his first taste of politics when he was recruited by local political activist Ruth Woo to work on various rampaigns, including Dolores Sibonga's successful bid for a seat on the City Council. He enjoyed the process, and in 1982, Locke decided to run for representative of the 37th District. From mid-July to the September primary election, he door-belled every day.


""I've been chased by dogs, bitten by dogs and had doors slammed in my face,"" he said. ""But people are also pleased and excited to talk to a candidate on their doorstep.""


He won the election and joined state politics in Olympia, a process he was already familiar with as a former attorney with the Senate Higher Education Committee and editor of a senate report containing a summary of current bills. But as a state representative, he describes his initiation as ""a heady process."" ""I was in awe of the whole thing -- to have people looking up to you,"" Locke said.


Locke feels that few people enter politics because of the difficulties of mounting an effective election campaign. A primary election campaign can cost approximately $20,000, with another $20,000 for the general election. Unseating an incumbent can also be difficult, then there is the arduous campaign work itself.


""Working on other people's campaigns doesn't compare to being a candidate,"" Locke said. ""Compared to other professions, it's grueling. If you are willing to doorbell, you stand a good chance. You have to have the energy and commitment to mount an aggressive campaign.""


Few minorities get into politics because they want to get ahead professionally, he added. But he also feels that Asian Americans are finally gaining political ground with the increasing number of Asian American elected officials, and with organizations like an emerging national Chinese American political coalition, the nationwide organization that responded to the murder of Vincent Chin, and Asian American caucuses within the Democratic party that have demanded better representation. Asian Americans, he said, will never be appointed to high national office because ""there is no hope for the Reagan administration.""


""We've been the quiet minority too long,"" Locke said. ""We're making progress -- maybe not as much as we would like, but certainly nothing to sneeze at.""


Locke has received his share of racist comments on the House floor, including one from another representative who called him an ""inscrutable. Chinese."" Locke said he always tries to speak last during debate on the House floor ""to set them straight.""


But Locke has also garnered respect from his Republican colleagues, who claim that they listen to him on the House floor because he is very articulate, reasonable and sticks to the issues and not to rhetoric and popular trends.


""I try to overcome prejudice by being a damn good legislator,"" Locke said.


As far as his own political future, Locke said that is ""all a matter of luck and timing."" Vacancies in political office are unpredictable, or a Democratic candidate could run in a primary with eight other Democrats and ""get lost in the pack."" He would like to someday take on the chairmanship of the House Ways and Means Committee, but meanwhile, his main concern is to ""establish a good record from which to run.""

A lot of people are marveling at a recent American report about Japanese schools. No wonder the Japanese have come so far in so short a time, they're saying, look at the education system.


The U.S. Department of Education report, ""Japanese Education Today,"" was prompted by a meeting between President Reagan and Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone in 1983.


According to the study, Japanese students score much higher than Americans on standardized math and science fests, develop better language skills and generally behave better in the classroom. As a nation, Japan has the highest literacy rate in the world.


I have as much respect as anyone for the post-war success of Japan and the schools hat helped bring it about. When I lived in Tokyo from 1981 to 1984, I was impressed with the tremendous energy and diligence of Japanese of all ages to get ahead. It even rubbed off on me.


But glowing admiration for the Japanese often obscures the emotional and psychological cost of a system that is both rigid and demanding.


Hard work has never hurt anyone, but the Japanese take that to an extreme. It all starts at an early age in the nation's schools. The desire to get into a good university is so intense it filters down to elementary school. There are even certain urban kindergartens that promise entrance to prestigious elementary schools which in turn will get the student into ""escalator"" junior high and high schools and on to the right college. The ultimate goal a Good job at a Good Company Graduates of top universities such as Tokyo or Keio universities make big impressions on big companies.


The pressure this puts on kids is hard to fathom. They attend classes six days a week, 240 days a year (vs. 180 in the U.S.). One to two hours of homework is routinely assigned to elementary school students, much more to older students. Junior and senior high school students wear black uniforms and adhere to strict standards of grooming. No long hair for girls, no ""perms"" for boys. There is a feeling of almost military regimentation.


In the afternoon, many students go to special test-prep schools called juku. The routine there is even stricter than at regular school. Students wear headbands with inspirational slogans on them. Juku teachers sometimes carry bamboo sticks used for emphatic rapping on students' desks.


Students prepare for their whole academic lives to take the college entrance exam, and the month or two before the test is called ""examination hell.""


When a student passes the top-rated Tokyo University test, a jubilant throng of classmates celebrate by tossing the lucky one in the air. Some students spend years trying to pass. Failure causes disappointment and sometimes severe depression. Japan has one of the highest teen suicide rates in the world, and suicide notes frequently refer to the unbearable pressure at school. To the alarm of parents and educators, incidents of vandalism, school violence and bullying have also been on the rise.


The Education Department's report praises the involvement of Japanese parents in their children's schooling. But, in fact, fathers typically work 10 to 12 hours a day and don't have much time for their families. It is the mothers, often called ""kyoiku mamas"" (education mamas), who are the driving force behind the system. They exhort their children, but also pamper them so that they'll have the time and uncluttered mindset for their studies.


Yes, the children are good students, but at what cost? The intense pressure often forces them to subsume their natural curiosities and individual characters. One telling study reveals that Japanese children spend less time playing than their Western counterparts.


Having said all that, I am hesitant to completely condemn the Japanese system. Not all high school students go on to college (around 40 percent do), and of those who do, not everyone fits the mold. I met a number of young Japanese who could express themselves as individuals and welcomed the challenge of frank cross-cultural exchange. And Japanese educators are pushing for reform to make the system less rigid.


What's good for the group in Japan is considered good for the country. The Japanese education system engenders a highly literate and trainable populace that is ideal for the efficient functioning of a modern industrial nation. In a country with 120 million people packed in an area the size of Maine, rocking the boat might well over-turn it.


American businesses have adopted Japanese methods with notable success in recent years, but I don't see much in the Japanese education system that could take root in this country.


Let's just say that it wouldn't work for us. Seeking higher standards may be an admirable goal, but before we use the Japanese system as a model, we should be aware of the potential consequences.


American schools need shaping up, but the problems are of our own making and have their solutions. The strength of American education has always been in its promise of developing individual potential while maintaining standards of academic excellence. At their best, our schools give us challenging and varied curricula that mirrors the diversity of cultures and histories that make up our country.


Despite the disappointing results in recent years, we should renew our commitment to these ideals -- not import a system that, on the surface, produces higher test scores.

In this issue, the Examiner looks at Asian small businesses, a vital component of the economic and social life of Seattle, particularly in certain neighborhoods like the International District.


This issue is made possible by a grant from Seafirst Bank.


As part of this edition, we focus on 22 Japanese American businesses saluted by the Seattle Chapter of the Japanese American Citizens League (JACL) at its 65th annual installation banquet last month. These family businesses, 19 of which are still operating today, were founded prior to World War II. This article combines information gathered by JACL and staff writer Ken Machizula.


City Produce


Shosaku Suyama arrived in Seattle from Japan at age 18. In 1926, Suyama operated his own produce business by going house-to-house and taking orders. He bought City Produce Co., located at 10th Avenue and Weller Street, in 1938. Suyama eventually moved his produce business to its present location on Seventh Avenue between Lane and Dearborn Street. He was semi-active in the businesses until his 80s, and passed away last year at age 94. His son, Nobi, now owns and manages City Produce.


Cherry Land/Garland Florist


Cherry Land Florist started as a small store when Tamano Kobata opened the business in the late 1920s. The operation grew and covered nearly one block when it was located where the Interstate 5 freeway now stands. After World War II, in 1946, Doc and Kako Shinbo resumed the family business. Today, their daughter, Tomi Takano, and son, George Shinbo, carry on what is now called Garland Florist. It is located on Jackson Street, a block east of where the business first started.


Columbia Greenhouse


Grandfather Noji arrived in America when he was 13-years-old and later started Columbia Greenhouse in the 1920s. They were first located in the Greenlake and West Seattle areas until he moved the business to its present site in the Rainier Valley and opened another branch in Kent. Assisted by his sons, Mitsugi and Oliver, they grew vegetables, lilies, geraniums and pot fuschias in 12 greenhouses. Mitsugi and his wife, Fumi, later ran the business.


During World War II, Mr. and Mrs. Joe Marshall lived in the Noji home and took care of the greenhouses. After the war, seven more greenhouses opened. In 1959, grandson Herb entered the business and he presently operates the greenhouses, along with Betty and Jiro Yoshitake. Today, Columbia Greenhouse is a wholesale outlet that sells to chain stores. They also provide plant maintenance services to department stores where their plants appear.


Higo Variety Store


Sanzo Murakami worked as a chef at the Olympus Cafe in Pioneer Square. He later opened Higo Shokai variety store in the 1920s, at the site where the Sun Ya Restaurant now stands. To become more Americanized, Murakami changed the name to Higo Ten Cent Store. In 1932, the Murakami family moved the variety store to its present location on Jackson Street.


Higo Ten Cent Store was forced to close during World War II, but their neighbor, Julius Blumenthal of Jackson Loan Office, took care of the Murakami's store and regularly deposited their rent in the bank. In 1956 the Murakamis remodeled their building. The architect who did the remodeling jokingly advised the Murakamis to rename their store Higo Variety Store ""because everything in the store was no longer 10 cents anymore,"" said present owner Masa Murakami. In the past, Higo Variety Store imported Japanese mannequins to display kimonos, and the store was the first to sell automaticrice cookers.


Ishimitsu & Sons


Kichisaburo Ishimitsu arrived in the U.S. in 1906 and worked on the railroad, in canneries in Alaska and Anacortes, and in sawmills and logging camps in Olympia. He later became a carpenter's helper and began construction on his own. In 1939, Ishimitsu, along with four other carpenters, built the Kendo Hall (now Nisei Veterans Hall) for $2,000.


As a labor contractor, Ishimitsu knew little English, but was able to obtain building permits through ""a combination of broken English and sign language,"" said his son, Kaz, who now runs Ishimitsu & Sons. He said building permits were easier to obtain in those days ""as long as the work was proper.""


Kichisaburo Ishimitsu, who will turn 100 this year, still goes to work with his son for a few hours each day. Kaz attributes his father's longevity to a diet of fish and vegetables, a limited consumption of red meat and reduced stress in his daily life.


Jackson Furniture


Heizo Hidaka bought Jackson Furniture in the 1930s when it was located on the corner near the Bush Hotel. During evacuation, Hidaka sold and auctioned off the store and all its inventory. Upon his return to Seattle, he waited for his son, Tom, to be discharged from the army and started the store from scratch again. Jackson Furniture reopened in 1948 at its present site on Jackson Street and is operated by Tom Hidaka.


Kubota Gardening Company


Kubota Gardens was designated a historic city land-mark in 1980. A local writer described it in this way: ""Its roots are in Japan, but it has a freer, less formal spirit inspired by the Northwest.""


Kubota Gardens is a tribute to its designer, Fujitaro Kubota. He atttended agricultural school in Japan, and, after arriving in the U.S., he worked in a sawmill and operated hotels and apartments. He started his gardening and landscaping business in the early 1920s. Since Japanese immigrants could not own land, he later bought land in South Seattle under his son's name.


Kubota was able to hold onto his land during the war by renting it out. Upon his return, he discovered that his prize gardens had been neglected and overgrown. But he determinedly restored his gardens as a way of showing his customers what he could do. ""He was always hidden in the weeds whenever I saw him,"" said his daughter-in-law. Amy Kubota.


H.T. Kubota Investment Company


H.T. Kubota came to the U.S. from Ehime, Japan and worked in sawmills and round houses for Great Northern Railway. He began buying and operating hotels in 1930, and during the Depression, ran 16 hotels, including the Crown and the New Home Hotel. In 1940, he bought the Seattle Hotel near the Smith Tower. From 1952 to 1961, Kubota served at president of the Seattle Japanese Hotel and Apartment Association. Today, he still owns the Seattle Hotel, Arlington Hotel, Globe Hotel and the building now housing Mikado Restaurant.


Linc's Tackle & Honda


Linc Beppu started Togo Fishing Tackle in 1935 on Third Avenue and James Street, ""right where you pay your parking tickets nowdays,"" he said Back then, he sold fishing tackle, bowling balls and shirts, skis and ""lost it all"" during evacuation, he said Beppu moved his business to its present location on Rainier Avenue in 1950.


Before the war, Beppu said fishing was as big a sport as it is today. He remembers a lot of Issei and Nisei owning boats to fish on Elliott Bay. In 1937, Beppu and his business started Seattle's International Salmon Derby in Elliott Bay because Asians were not allowed into other major fishing derbies in Seattle.


M.K. Fish Company


At age 19, Kensaku Murata left Japan for England. Five years later, he found himself in America, working for Great Northern Railroad Co. in White Fish, Montana. While working at Seattle's Main Fish Co. in 1918, he purchased and started his own fish store on Main Street. In 1954, he opened another branch of his store on Yesler Way and 18th Avenue. Murata closed his Main Street store in 1966 and combined it with the present store on Yesler Way.


The Japanese American community has long been familiar with M.K. Fish, where they can buy such speciality foods such as tofu, satsumage and kamaboko. Murata passed away in 1974, and his niece, Aikiko Narusawa, and her husband, Susumu, carry on the business.


Mizuki Nursery


In 1906, Giichiro Mizuki arrived in Bellingham and attended school there. He worked as a jitney driver transporting passengers for five cents each. During World War I, Mizuki owned a cab company in Seattle that was second only to Yellow Cab. He later operated a grocery store in the early 1920s and a dime store in the late 20s, located on Broadway, north of Seattle Community College Mizuki later changed the location of his dime store to Jackson Street.


In 1925 Mizuki started gardening and continued until World War II. After the war, the established Mizuki Nursery, which is now being run by his second son, Bill.


Eldest son Jim remembers that his father spoke English at home, which was unusual for a first-generation Japanese, and it is the reason why he cannot speak the language now.


North American Post


The Japanese-language North American Post was originally called Hokubei Jiji when it was founded by Kiyoshi Kumamoto in 1902. The original site of the newspaper office was on Jackson Street, across from Union Station. The Arima brothers -- Sumikiyo, Sumiyoshi and Sumio -- assumed operation of the paper until December 8, 1941, when they published their last edition.


In 1946, Sadahiko Ikoma started the business again as a weekly paper under the name North American Post. West Coast Printing printed the newspaper. In 1950, the North American Post became a corporation. In 1954, under president Heiji Okuda, and later, H.T. Kubota, the newspaper published daily.


In 1981, the North American Post reduced its publishing to three times a week. Yoshito Fujii now heads the North American Post corporation, and Noboru Kageyama is publisher.


The newspaper now prints a page in English once a week. The circulation is decreasing, mainly due to the disappearance of the Issei generation, but the newspaper staff is optimistic.


""We are in good spirits, we have good people, and we should survive under any circumstances,"" said Associate Editor Mitsuko Okada.


North Coast Importing Co.


Tadashi Yamaguchi arrived in Bellingham, then left for Seattle to work for North Coast Grocery and Trading in 1919. In 1927, Yamaguchi assumed ownership of the business, which became North Coast Importing Co. The company sold wholesale groceries to restaurants and markets in the Seattle area. Yamaguchi was able to own the company's building in the International District by leaving it in trust to his sons.


Yamaguchi's son, Kay, who now runs the business, remembers that Tashiro Hardware stored inventory and equipment in their building during evacuation. The Yamaguchis left the key with their accountant, who was white. North Coast Importing resumed operation in 1945.


Before passing away at age 92, Tadashi Yamaguchi was involved with many community organizations, including Japanese Community Service, JACL and Jackson Street Community Service. He also received an award from the government of Japan for his service to the Japanese community. Kay credits his father's business success to having ""good advisers,"" many of whom were non-Japanese.


State Drug


Nobuichi Tsutsumoto, a pharmacist in Japan, immigrated to the U.S., took the state board exams, and ended up working in a hospital pharmacy in Wyoming. He later opened his own Seattle pharmacy in the late 1920s on Fifth Avenue and Main Street.


Tsutsumoto, a prominent member of Japanese community clubs, was taken away by the FBI during the evening of December 7, 1941. His son, Ben, who now runs State Drug, credits another neighborhood pharmacist, George Tokuda, with helping his mother maintain the pharmacy while his father was away.


The Tsutsumoto family, separated during the war, reunited after relocation and reopened State Drug on Jackson Street. Ben and his wife, Sally, have continued the business at their present location on Rainier Avenue and King Street since 1958.


C.T. Takahashi & Company


Charles Takahashi, born in Gifu, Japan, started Oriental Trading Company in the 1890s. Besides importing and exporting Oriental goods, he became a leading railway contractor for Great Northern Railway. Takahashi secured employment for over 2,000 men, with branches of his company in Spokane, Portland, Vancouver, B.C. and in Montana.


Takahashi passed away in his 40s. His son, Charles Theodore, continues C.T. Takahashi & Company. Victor Kihara, son-in-law to Charles Theodore, said the elder Takahashi must have been well-educated and proficient in English, since he dealt with and became a friend of James Hill, founder of Great Northern Railway. Charles Theodore Takahashi and James Hill's son worked during summers as waterboys for the railroad crews.


Uwajimaya Inc.


Fujimatsu Moriguchi arrived in Seattle from Uwajimaya, Japan in 1923. His primary interest was to learn about American fish production, so he quickly found employment at Main Fish Company and worked there for five years. By 1928, he saved enough money to purchase a fruck and start his own store in Tacoma, which he called Uwajimaya.


With the evacuation, Moriguchi was forced to sell out his business. After the war, and with seven children, he began all over again, starting a small fish market on Main Street. Noticing the scarcity and demand for authentic Japanese products, he began importing increasing quantities of Japanese food, tableware and gift items. In 1962, Moriguchi, whose health was failing, opened a gift shop at the Seattle World's Fair. He passed away that summer.


His son, Tomio, now runs Uwajimaya Inc. The blue-tiled main store in the International District opened in 1970, and there are now also branches in Bellevue and Southcenter.


West Coast Printing


Ted and Paul Tomita both worked for a printer before starting their own print shop, West Coast Printing, in 1930. During the war, they stored their equipment in a friend's warehouse and started again after the war with their business located on Main Street. In 1952, the Tomitas moved to their present location on Rainier Avenue. West Coast Printing owns the only commercial Japanese printer in Seattle and they donate their services to many community organizations. The business is now owned by Ted's sons, Ted Jr. and Eric, but Ted Sr. and his wife Masako, still work every day.


T. Yoruzu Gardening Company


Established by Tokisaburo Yorozu in 1923, son William took over the business 12 years later due to his father's illness. William has been involved in the company for over 52 years, which mainly functions as a landscape contractor, primarily doing government work. William's two sons, Kenneth and David, are now associates in his business. Both hold degrees in landscape architecture from Washington State, and Kenneth earned an additional degree from Ohio State University.


Among the major landscaping projects they have completed: SeaTac Airport passenger terminal building, Seattle Public Library University of Washington Arboretum Japanese Tea Garden, Waterfall Garden for United Parcel Service in Pioneer Square and the Children's Park in the International District.


T. Yorozu Gardening Company received the American Association of Nurserymen's National Landscape Award for the Waterfall Garden. The award was presented by Mrs. Nancy Reagan at the White House.


Y. Fujii Investment Company


Yoshito Fujii came to America and joined his older brother, Chojiro Fujii, who established the Fujii Hotel in 1902. Yoshito graduated from the University of Washington with a sociology degree in 1928, then also entered the hotel business and purchased the Cascade Building in downtown Seattle. After the war, he acquired the Holland Hotel, Rivoli Apartments and the Wilhard Apartments. Yoshito is now 85, but remains active in the apartment business and owns two apartment buildings on Capitol Hill.


Fuji 10 Cent Store


Fuji 10 Cent Store closed at the end of last year after 70 years of business. Tsuyoshi (Tom) Horike remembers his father and a relative, Mr. Takagaki, opening the business and selling all their inventory for 49 cents or less.


Komaichi Horike, Tom's father, and Takagaki started their family business in 1915. In the mid-20s, Takagaki left the business and Komaichi Horike assumed sole ownership of the operation. During this time, Horike and his five children traveled to Japan.


In 1930, Tom returned, and worked for the family store near Lincoln High School in Tacoma. Around 1936, a family friend, Ayako Sakamoto, came to work at the Fuji store. She and Tom married in 1942.


With the evacuation, the family was forced to close all three stores. Tom and his family moved to Los Angeles after the war and opened a Fuji 10 Cent Store there. Upon returning to the Northwest in 1953, the Horike family opened the store in the Wallingford area of Seattle. Through the years, other Fuji 10 Cent Stores opened in the Greenwood and Queen Anne areas, and in Fife, Washington.


Panama Hotel


The Panama Hotel in the International District was purchased by the Hori family in 1938. At that time, all the tenants in the hotel were Japanese. During the war, members of the Japanese community used the basement of the hotel to store their possessions while they were interned in the relocation camps.


Tobo Oriental Imports


After selling Japanese food and merchandise since 1948, Tobo Oriental Imports, located at 12th Avenue and Weller Street, closed its doors at the end of last year. In a recent interview with the Examiner, owners Yoshi Suzuki and George and Maly Tamura remembered the business.


The Suzuki family lived in Spokane and later moved to Seattle. Maly said her mother, Yoshi, was blessed with a ""strong business sense"" and started the import shop about one block north of the store's recent location. At first, the Suzuki family were absentee managers. Tono Mochizuki handled daily management for about five years, with assistance from Mrs. Suzuki's daughter, Alice Hayashida. Much of their inventory was food supplies, and orders were placed to Japan and managed there by Yoshi's brother-in-law. They imported foods like nori, konbu and dried oysters.


In 1954, Yoshi Suzuki took over daily store duties. Alice assumed more responsibility, and in 1960, Maly's husband, George, joined the staff. The shop began to increase the variety of items they sold, but it became increasingly difficult to maintain adequate inventory because of the expensive cost for goods such as lacquerware and bronzeware.


Maly said she and George, will ""miss the customer contact and feel very fortunate to know so many loyal friends and customers and the occasional times when people would bring in baked goods.""


At age 90, Yoshi Suzuki plans to be active in a senior citizens group, do jigsaw puzzles and work in her garden.

The fallout from the Iran Contra scandal is reaching far beyond the corridors and basements of power in the nation's capitol and is beginning to affect U.S. foreign policy, said Nayan Chanda, Washington bureau chief for the Far Eastern Economic Review, Chanda was in Seattle last week for a series of talks on Cambodia and Vietnam.


A case in point, Chanda said is U.S. relations with Indochina. Before his recent troubles. President Reagan was said to be warming to the idea of taking his place in history as the president who re-established ties with Vietnam, much in the same way Nixon reopened relations with China. But the scandal has so weakened the presidency that any such controversial move would now be unthinkable, Chanda said:


And yet, if the Northwest and other regions are serious about staking a large part of their future on trade with Pacific Rim countries, the U.S. cannot sit back and watch, said Chanda, a journalist noted for his coverage of Southeast Asia.


""If the U.S. wants to maintain its global posture, it cannot renounce its role in Southeast Asia,"" he said.


Current American policy is discreet. According to Chanda, the U.S. is providing $19 million in covert and over aid to the Cambodian resistance Much of the money is channeled through Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) members to provide arms. Through official channels, the U.S. continues to press Vietnam to release information about American MIAS, to improve its human rights record and to withraw its troops from Cambodia.


If anyone knows about the situation in war-scarred Southeast Asia, it is Chanda. His name has become legend among fellow journalists because of his exclusive coverage of the the fall of South Vietnam.


About two weeks before the U.S. abandoned its embassy in Saigon in April, 1975, most of the major news services and other media were withdrawing their correspondents. The British news service Reuters was no exception, but it asked Chanda, then the Indochina correspondent for the Far Eastern Economic Review to carry on. He agreed and set up in the Reuters office, which was adjacent to the presidential palace. Chanda watched as North Vietnamese tanks rolled into the city and he was the first to break the news to the outside world.


Chanda remained in Saigon (now called Ho Chi Minh City) for another three months and since then has continued his reporting on the area. He is known for his well-balanced accounts and for having access to a multitude of sources on all sides of an issue.


He's been back to the area several times since '75. Of the current situation, he says. ""There's an eerie feeling that we've been there before.""


Many of the actors have changed and there has been one major strategic turnabout. In 1970, China supported the Cambodian resistance forces against the U.S. backed Lon Nol regime. Today, the Cambodiam resistance is backed by both the U.S. and China against the Sovietsupported Vietnamese.


Even so much of the passion and antipathy and many of the slogans and ideologies have remained the same.


If any lessons can be drawn from the 12 years since the U.S. left Vietnam it is that history is relentless, says Chanda, who has an M. A. in history and lectured on Asian history at universities in his native India.


Historically, intense nationalism has determined events in the region. For centuries, Vietnam, Cambodia Laos, Thailand and numerous ethnic tribes have waged bloody wars for supremacy and self determination.


The French followed by the American presence in Indochina, froze the historical conflict,"" said Chanda.


""But the day the U.S. left the course resumed -- the inevitable conflict that lies deep in history.""


""For the U.S. to lightly side with any country without understanding the history . . . is very short-sighted, indeed.""


The U.S. wants to remove the Vietnamese from Cambodia. But once the Vietnamese go, the communist Khmer Rouge would most likely resume power said Chanda. The U.S. doesn't want that but would be hard pressed to oppose it without damaging its relationship with China. A settlement that would involve a guarantee of security for Vietnam and a nonaligned Cambodia needs to be worked out beforehand, he said.


While acknowledging that Vietnam has rewritten Cambodian textbooks and otherwise has a strong presence in Cambodia, Chanda dismisses reports of massive Vietnamese resettlement. In fact there are actually fewer Vietnamese in Cambodia today than in 1970, Lon Nol, who took power in '70 and then Pol Pot, who took over in '75, killed or chased many Vietnamese away Most who are now resettling in Cambodia have lived there before.


Twelve years after the fall of South Vietnam, Chanda says conditions are still very bad. ""It's depressing to go back.""


Despite a lettering economy and a disarray in leadership (in February the Cabinet underwent a major reshuffle) . . . sees little chance that the government will be toppled. ""The military is too strong,"" he said.


He has noticed improvements. There are more goods on the streets of Ho Chi Minh City. In the country side, the farmers have gone back to their land.


Are conditions worse or better?


""Only the people can say, and I don't pretend to speak for them,"" said Chanda. ""But the people who choose to leave obviously feel strong enough to take enormous risks -- one can suffer under bombs and under political oppression.""


He said the problem of refugees can only be solved by getting at the root of the conflict and attaining a lasting peace. By closing its refugee camps, Thailand is sending a signal to the West accept more refugees into your countries and help work toward a settlement that permits people to go back to their own countries.


While in Seattle, Chanda also spoke with journalists from the Northwest Minority Media Association and the Asian American Journalists Association. He is the author of ""Brother Enemy: The War After the War,"" a book about post-1975 Vietnam.

Consul General of Japan Shigenobu Nagai blamed the American media and some members of Congress for the impression that Japan is engaging in unfair trading practices, a mistaken perception that may ""shatter the foundation"" of U.S.-Japan relations.


Nagai spoke at a World Affairs. Council luncheon last month.


The most recent development in what the national media has . . . ""trade war "" is the Reagan administration plan to impose 100 percent tariffs on $300 million worth of Japanese products in response to Japan's, alleged failure to stop dumping computer chips and to open its markets to American companies.


The move ""greatly disappointed"" the Japanese, Nagai said, ""Terms such as retaliation and 'punishment' are being used against your own trading partners,"" he said.


He pointed out that Japan's import quotas were no higher than in other industrialized countries. He also said Japan has been taking measures to open its market and increase domestic demand for American products.


And while the U.S. is burdened with a massive $58.6 billion trade deficit with Japan, the Japanese are having economic problems of their own. The appreciation of the yen has been the cause of increasing bankruptcies and unemployment. Sales of Japanese goods in the U.S. have fallen off sharply, Nagai said.


Nagai called for level-headed consideration of the issues and re-emphasized the importance of the U.S.-Japan relationship, which, he said, accounts for one quarter of all world trade.


""Let's not let one issue make us lose sight of the most important partnership the world,"" he said.


Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone a few days ago wound up a visit to Washington D.C., where he urged President Reagan and congressional leaders to refrain from imposing protectionist sanctions against Japan. At the same time, Congress was voting on a restrictive trade bill, including the Gephardt Amendment, which would impose mandatory tariffs and quota limits on countries that run up large trade deficits with the U.S.

Major new evidence has been uncovered in the six-year effort to link former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos to the 1981 murders of anti-Marcos activists Silme Domingo and Gene Viernes, it was announced last month.


The families of the two slain men filed a civil suit in 1982, charging that the Marcos regime ordered the murders to silence Domingo and Viernes, two local cannery union officials who had become leading opponents of the anti-Marcos movement in the U.S.


The Committee for Justice for Domingo and Viernes (CIDV), in press conferences in Seattle and San Francisco on April 15, said it has uncovered new evidence that corroborates both the existence of a secret Philippine intelligence slush fund for the murders and the role of Marcos associate Dr. Leonilo Malabed as the conduit for the funds.


Over a year ago, an expense statement of the now-defunct Mabuhay Corporation, headed by Malabed, was found on Marcos after he fled the Philippines. This statement itemized $750,000 in expenditures by the government-controlled Philippine National Bank (PNB), under the authority of former General Fabian Ver.


The plaintiffs have charged that the San Francisco-based. Mabuhay Corporation was established as a cover for the Marcos regime to fund propaganda activities in the U.S., make campaign contributions to candidates and fund more sinister ""special security projects"" as part of the Philippine government's, intelligence operations against the anti-Marcos movement in the U.S.


The CIDV, last month announced that deposition testimony, public statements and bank records confirm that Malabed received $190,000 from the PNB and over $500,000 in cash from a secret Philippine government courier in 1979 and later to pay for the ""projects.""


The CIDV believes it has strong circumstantial evidence that one security project-expenditure of $15,000 was made on May 17, 1981 as payment for the murders. That same day, former cannery union president. Tony . . . travelled to San Francisco for 24 hours and stayed at a hotel hear the Philippine Consulate.


Terri Mast, plaintiff and widow of Domingo, said Baruso has stated that he didn't remember the San Francisco trip and also invoked the 5th Amendment shield against self-incrimination on other questions related to the murders. . . . has never been charged for the murders.


Both Marcos and Malabed, when asked about the transfer of funds on that date in recent depositions also invoked the 5th Amendment. Malabed took the 5th Amendment when asked about, the murders, but admitted authoring the expense sheet at the request of Marcos.


The CIDV says it has secured bank records of the Mabuhay Corporation that confirm other expenditures from the expense sheet for various campaign contributions in the U.S.


With the latest evidence, the plaintiffs filed a motion on April 15 before Judge Donald Voorhees in U.S. District Court to add Malabed as a defendant in the suit.


""The mention of Ver as the authorizing agent for these special security projects clearly establishes the link to the upper levels of the murder conspiracy,"" Mast stated Ver has also been linked to the IranContra scandal as having, signed for the receipt of an arms shipment destined for Iran.


The CIDV recently presented over 1,000 signatures to federal authorities demanding criminal investigations into the activities of Marcos, Ver, Malabed and Baruso. Three Bay Area Congressional Representatives -- Ron Dellums. Don Edwards and Barbara Boxer -- and Hawan . . . Daniel Inouye have asked federal authorities to look into the Mabhay-Corporation.


Cindy Domingo, national . . . the CJDV, said ""A full, impartial and vigorous investigation of all this evidence is called for.


Mean while, to commemorate the sixth anniversary of the murders, a June 6 conference will explore the increasing repression against those in the U.S. who actively oppose Reagan's foreign policy.


The conference, co-sponsored by the CJDV and labor, solidarity, religious, and peace groups, will draw parallels between the Domingo-Viernes murders and the deportation efforts against Palestinian and Kenyan activists in Los Angeles, and the attacks and break-ins against Central American refugee and solidarity activists.


Prominent national speakers will participate in the event, scheduled for Saturday, June 6 at 1 p.m. at the Labor Temple For more information, call 324-0500.

""We're putting our population in jeopardy,"" Gonzales said. ""Once, out people start coming home in boxes, we'll feel the same pain that the people of El Salvador and Nicaragua are feeling with their children and relatives being killed.""


It is Gonzales's job to inform the minority community and organize them around the issue of Central America, ""We have no position on the legitimacy of the war,"" he said. ""We just look at U.S. policy vis-a-vis our desire for peace.""


Gonzales also pointed out that the Reagan administration's support of the . . . El Salvador and Nicaragua has affected the various social programs in the community. ""In a sense, we're also affected by the escalation of the war in Central America,"" he said.


Although Gonzales realizes that more and more Americans are joining the military service for economic reasons, he cautioned them about becoming the ""next batch of cannon fodder"" in a senseless war.


""If there would be a war in Nicaragua, it would be a Black American soldier killing another Black Nicaraguan soldier,"" Gonzales said.

Seventeen months after President Corazon Aquino took power, the Filipino people are confronted with a government that has stabilized and consolidated itself into a conservative regime dominated by the Philippine elite.


The government's conservative character is crystal clear: most of the progressive or liberal democratic members of the Cabinet have been purged and replaced by conservative appointees. For instance, pro-labor Minister Augusto Sanchez was replaced by Franklin Drillon, a management specialist friendly to the multinational corporations. Jaime Ferrer, a man with close ties to the CIA, took over as Minister of Local Government.


The conservative essence of the government is nowhere more evident than in the area of economic and social policy. Under the leadership of Finance Minister Jaime Ongpin the regime has adopted the World Bank-International Monetary Fund prescription to dismantle the protective barriers to foreign imports, a move which will accelerate the bankruptcy of hundreds of local entrepreneurs.


The Constitution, drafted mainly by representatives of the upper class, is a document which would be readily endorsed by Reagan's economic advisors, enshrining as the fundamental principles of Philippine economiclife. The document also liberalizes conditions to penetrate strategic sectors of Philippine economy.


It appears that the President herself does not believe in land reform and considers it chiefly as a campaign promise that was made to be broken. After assuming office, Aquino stated in an interview that justice in the countryside was ""not so much a matter of distributing land, but of enabling people to share profits. By sharing out the land, you only create more problems because sugar cultivation, for instance, is definitely uneconomic if carried out in small plots.""


The government appears democratic, but this is only a facade for the reassertion of traditional elite rule. The Philippines has recently undergone two exercises in electoral politics -- a plebiscite on the new Constitution and elections to the new Congress -- leading many local and foreign observers to proclaim the return and institutionalization of democracy in the Philippines.


What is being institutionalized, however, are the old processes of elite, patronage democracy in which money and wealth determine who wins in elections and what ""solutions"" are allowed for pressing social and economic problems. The pro-elite bias of formal democracy was evident in the last Congressional elections, where wealthy candidates had the privilege of monopolizing radio and television spots.


While the government attempts to legitimize its rule through normal democratic mechanisms, military repression continues to he an important means of political control. After considerable fractrousness and resentment in the office corps in 1986 -- a mood expressed in various coup attempts -- the military, headed by AFP Chief of Staff General Fidel Ramos, appears to have reconciled itself to living with Aquino as President.


But the military has exacted a high price, the President's abandonment of any serious effort to prosecute human rights offenders during the Marcos era; her tacit acceptance of the enormous political and economic privileges amassed by the military over 14 years; and her giving free reign to the military's terroristic methods of putting down the people's movement.


Some progressive groups in the Philippines and in the United States use the term ""U.S.-Aquino Regime"" to characterize her government. This is not without basis. The government enjoys the endorsement and full support of the Reagan administration. In May of last year, President Aquino and her advisers told the U.S. that they preferred economic to military aid. Three months ago, Aquino was urgently requesting 150 helicopters from Washington for counterinsurgency use and complained that the U.S. had been tardy in delivering the military aid it promised last year.


Though there are no U.S. ground troops fighting the New People's Army at this time the U.S. is directly and heavily involved in what is now termed ""low intensity conflict"" in the Philippines. Perhaps the most dramatic indicator of the importance which the U.S. attaches to this area of counterinsurgency is the Reagan administration's recent authorization of a 10 percent increase in CIA personnel attached to the U.S. embassy in Manila and a $10 million budget for surveillance and covert action.


As the public hearings on the Iran-Contra affair have revealed, the network of right-wing private organizations has played a critical role in carrying out the Reagan administration's policies in Central America. Some of this cast of characters are-also active in the Philippines: General John Singlaub, CAUSA, the political arm of the Unincation Church headed by Reverend Sun Myung Moon and the Christian Anti-Communist Crusade. All these personalities and groups have been linked to the growth of the anti-communist vigilante groups.


In sum, the U.S. is heavily involved, either directly or via the international network of right-wingers in counterinsurgency in the Philippines. In many respects, this involvement appears to be greater than it was under Marcos.

Forty-five years ago, the U.S. government herded the entire West Coast Japanese American population into 10 concentration camps without charges or trials. The Japanese American community, deemed guilty by reason of race, has fought against heavy odds to obtain redress for the injustices suffered during those dark days of World War II. Now, after so many years, victory appears within reach.


Redress legislation has ""better than a fifty-fifty chance of passage before the end of the year,"" according to Congressman Mike Lowry in a recent speech before a regional conference of the Japanese American Citizens League (JACL). According to the Legislative Education Committee of JACL, redress bills await full floor votes in both the House and the Senate, with a vote in the House scheduled for September 17.


The House redress bill, HR 442, has 167 co-sponsors to date, while the Senate version has 76 co-sponsors. Redress supporters estimate they need to line up at least 50 more votes in the House to insure passage. Lowry, the earliest supporter of Japanese American redress in Congress, believes this can be done if public pressure and lobbying are stepped up now.


Lowry warned, however, that the biggest fight may not be over the bill itself, but over amendments. Rep. Dan Lungren (R-Calif.) is expected to push an amendment eliminating the provision for direct monetary compensation to former internees. If successful, this would effectively cut the heart out of redress and reduce it to an exercise in tokenism.


The three key provisions of the redress bills call for $20,000 in direct monetary compensation to all those unjustly interned during World War II, an official apology from the U.S. government and a trust fund for research and education regarding the internment. Other provisions pertain to federal pensions, government service seniority rights and pardons. All told, the redress bill calls for $1.25 to $1.3 billion, with payments most likely spread out over several years.


Lowry also noted that passage of the current bills would only authorize the government to spend the money. A second bill would need to be passed to actually appropriate funds to implement the bill. This gives some legislators an opportunity to vote for redress in principle, while later voting against it in practice. The struggle does not end with one positive vote.


There is always the possibility of a presidential veto. Lowry, however, points out that the White House has been very silent on the issue. Even a Reagan White House, he surmised, might be hesitant to veto legislation so clearly related to constitutional rights and government abuse of power, particularly in the wake of the Iran-Contra scandal.


Redress supporters feel the time is ripe for victory, but they need continued public support. Cherry Kinoshita, vice chair of JACL's legislative education committee, stresses the importance of people lobbying their Congressional representatives immediately, urging them to pass HR 442 intact on September 17.

""It's been a long seven years,"" Mike Lowry told a gathering of local Asian Americans last week, ""but I see light at the end of the tunnel.""


The tunnel, many in the audience would have agreed, is a metaphor for how President Reagan and his administration have viewed social services in this country.


Lowry had a measure of good news: the mood in Washington is slowly changing. He cited the recent passage of a bill for the homeless, a measure he sponsored. ""We never would have been able to pass that legislation three or four years ago,"" he said. ""It shows how the tide is turning.""


It can't turn quick enough for needy in the International District and elsewhere in the Asian community. At the breakfast meeting with the Seventh District Democrat, Asian leaders expressed their frustration over program cuts and a variety of other issues.


In the process, Lowry learned something new about the problems of one segment of his constituency: Samoan Americans. Spokespersons for the group caught him unaware with their concerns over the lack of Samoan bilingual education and the general dearth of money for services for Pacific Islanders, especially for a senior center.


Lowry promised to look into the possibility of getting federal help for a bilingual program and senior center. ""Keep us informed,"" he urged the large Samoan contingent. ""That's why these meetings are good for me. I learn a lot of things that frankly I should have thought about before.""


Lowry also sympathized with refugee organizations facing funding cutbacks and the problem of refugees -- friends and relatives of recent immigrants -- stranded in camps in Thailand. He noted that the Immigration and Naturalization Service is understaffed and underfunded. He expressed hope that a new administration would bring policy changes from the top.


The personable congressman predicted better pay days for social services in the 1989 budget, but said that everyone must still deal with the national debt, which has soared to a mind-numbing $2 1/2 trillion. Lowry attributed the astronomical rises in year-to-year deficits to an excessive cut in taxes in 1981 and the doubling of the military budget under the Reagan administration. He said he favors a higher income tax to help remedy the imbalance.


""Maybe none of us likes to have our taxes raised, but sometimes we have to be responsible,"" he said.


Throwing up trade barriers, on the other hand, is not the answer, Lowry maintained.


""We're making a terrible mistake in this country when we point to the success of other countries as our problem,"" he said.


""We're blaming other nations for doing a good job -- that to me not a very wholesome attitude. We ought to be working on what we can do to make our products more competitive. What we can do is put more of our dollars into education ... production and research and development of commercial products as opposed to weapons systems.""


Rep. Richard Gephardt, the Democratic congressman from Missouri who sponsored a restrictive trade amendment, is ""just wrong on this issue."" said Lowry. ""And I think it's one of the reasons his presidential candidacy has not taken off. Good policy is good politics.""


In response to other questions, Lowry:


-- was optimistic about chances of a settlement ""within the next year"" of the root cause of the refugee problem: the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia.


-- reported community service and community development block grants for 1988 will be frozen at present levels.


-- backed South Pacific Islanders' right to self-determination and to remain nuclear-free (from testing and the presence of nuclear weapons). ""If I were there, that's what I would want.""


-- agreed wholeheartedly with the Chinese American group which is seeking commitments from presidential candidates for political appointments of Chinese Americans in exchange for campaign support.


When the subject of his own political aspirations arose, Lowry coyly asked: ""Is there a Senate race in 1988?"" whereupon Seattle City Councilwoman Dolores Sibonga began a chant, ""Run, Mike, run!""


After the laughter subsided, Lowry said his decision on whether to run for Dan Evans's Senate seat would be made early next year and would depend on Evans's voting record. If Evans continues on the conservative route, he can be defeated, Lowry said. ""I promise I will win a Democratic primary. The question is will I beat Dan Evans in the general? ... It's too early to tell.""


For the Democrats to regain the presidency, they must ""campaign like Democrats instead of closet Republicans,"" he said.


Lowry began the meeting by blasting Reagan's support for the Nicaraguan contras, saying it has been ""the major thing that has kept the war going."" He said continued aid to the rebels would destroy the best hope for peace in the region: the recent proposal by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias:


He condemned the selling of arms to Iran, calling it illegal and ""one of the dumbest foreign policy moves ever made."" He characterized the actions of Oliver North (""who is not a national hero""), John Poindexter and William Casey as those of a military group trying to subvert a civilian government.

Last week, 800 junior officers and soldiers of the Philippine military complaining that they are not respected by the government, attempted for the fifth time to overthrow the 18-month-old government of President Corazon Aquino. This coup attempt, the bloodiest so far, resulted in 40 deaths and 275 wounded.


Both President Aquino and Gen. Fidel Ramos, military chief of staff, have reassured the public that the ""government was in control"" and that, with mopping up operations underway, ""full order"" would be restored in Manila. About 816 rebel soldiers were in custody, but its leader, Col. Gregorio Honasan, remains at large.


At stake was whether the elements of the military would return the Philippines to a rule characterized by large scale repression, violation of human rights and fascist resurgence. If the coup attempt had succeeded the gains of the February revolution would have been reversed, setting back the democratization process and nation-building initiated by President Aquino.


On very short notice, 35 supporters from the Filipino and broader American community, mobilized by the Committee to Advance the Movement for Democracy and Independence in the Philippines (CAMDI) gathered in front of the Philippine Consulate in Seattle on August 28 to call for defense of the Aquino government from military takeover. These supporters were later joined by Consul General Jaime Bautista and Vice Consuls Ariel Abadilla and Louella Alcoba.


Reverend William Cate of the Church Council of Greater Seattle said he prayed for justice, freedom and peace. Dorothy Cordova read a statement on behalf of the Archdiocese of Seattle. Cindy Domingo, of the Committee for Justice for Domingo and Viernes, said Aquino should not hesitate to prosecute those responsible for the coup attempt. Written statements were also given by Terri Mast, president of IBU/ILWU Region 37, and Annie Tigtig of the Ninoy Aquino Movement.


As conditions normalize in the Philippines, progressives must continue to expand the democratic space provided by the Aquino government and continually press for issues of concern.


Despite Gen. Ramos's claims after the February revolution that the military had become a ""New Armed Forces,"" this powerful apparatus has not fundamentally changed. It is the same armed forces that excelled in suppressing democratic rights during the Marcos years.


Under the Aquino administration, the military still automatically resorts to brutal force in political situations. Its leadership adamantly opposed. President Aquino's early reconciliation move and demanded ""total war"" against the insurgency. The depth of the military's anti-democratic orientation was again revealed in January when the majority of the Armed Forces voted against the Constitution.


Recently, Defense Secretary Rafael Heto declared that the government was prepared to declare a limited state of emergency to deal with ""increasing political violence."" President Aquino correctly resisted that call, saying that she would not use ""undemocratic means to preserve democracy."" However, her present strategy of all-out war against the rebels can undermine her most sincere democratic intentions.


President Aquino has taken a conservative drift that strengthens the position of military advisors in her government. For example, her ""midnight decrees,"" set in motion just before the opening of the new Congress, have declared the Communist Party illegal, provide stiff penalties for rebellion, and encourage the existence of anti-communist vigilante groups.


These decrees are a blow to political pluralism. The tolerance of differing political views, as long as they share the rejection of fascism, is vital to the democratic order. Likewise, her government should exhaust all avenues for negotiation with the Left. It must turn its attention to reviving its partnership with the people and their organizations.


Such an alliance is also the only reliable shield against anti-democratic forces. To unleash the powerful potential of this partnership, President Aquino must be willing to find peaceful accommodation with the revolutionary movement, whose leaders represent legitimate grassroots concerns.


The government must not forget that negotiation is the only road to peace. As the euphoria of the February revolution begins to wear off, the challenge will be to advance the cause of social justice and peace amid the devastating economic crisis created by the Marcos regime. Attempts to overthrow the gains of the February revolution, to reinstate martial law and to restore fascism must be vigorously opposed.


President Aquino is right in saying: ""No concessions to the rebel military traitors and severe punishment be rendered to them."" Although Reagan has expressed unqualified support for the Aquino government during the the recent coup attempt, it is important for the U.S. to halt the efforts of CIA operatives, anti-communist groups like the Alsa Masa and Tadtad, missions of Gen. John Singlaub to the Philippines and alleged funding of the Reform the Armed Forces Movement, which was responsible for this bloody coup.


The democratic government that ousted the dictator Marcos is at a new juncture today. The recent coup has serious implications and we should continue to remain vigilant.

Indian American Joy Cherian was nominated to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) last month by President Reagan. If confirmed by the Senate, as expected, Cherian would become the first Asian American commissioner to the EEOC.


A naturalized American citizen born in India, Cherian will be named to serve the remaining term of Fred W. Alvarez, which expires July 1, 1988.


Cherian, 45, is currently the chairman of the Asian American Voters Coalition, an umbrella organization of Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Indian, Korean, Vietnamese, Guamanian and other Asian American groups. He is the director of International Insurance Law with the American Council of Life Insurance in Washington, D.C.


""I expect Dr. Cherian to play a key role in bringing a broader perspective to the work of the commission, making it even more sensitive to the concerns of those from other nations who have made America their adopted home,"" said EEOC Chairman Clarence Thomas.


Asian American activists have been pushing for an Asian EEOC commissioner for many years.


Visitation Valley Laundry, a Chinese-owned laundry in San Francisco, was cited last month for charging more for women's shirts than men's in violation of the city business code.


The issue arose last year when an aide to San Francisco Supervisor Richard Hongisto noticed the difference in prices on her dry cleaning bill. Hongisto's office had received other complaints about the practice.


An informal investigation of other dry cleaning stores in the city revealed that the pricing policy, charging a higher fee for laundering women's shirts, was common.


The city and fundries agreed that the practice was . . . and most laundries changed their pricing policies. Visitation Valley Laundry was charged because the owners refused to change their policy.


According to East/West newspaper, owners Zhong Ke Zhu, Ya Zhen Wu, Jung F. Gee and Tony Gee don't believe they did anything wrong, maintaining that women's shirts were indeed different from men's A lawyer for the owners said they would fight the case in court.


A California Superior Court jury on August 20 convicted a Los Angeles man of attacking and robbing California Secretary of State March Fong Eu in her home last year and for five other break-ins, the Rafu Shimpo reported.


Gregory Lee Moore, 28, could serve up to 24 years in prison for the 10 felony count convictions.


On November 10, 1986, Eu was beaten with the blunt end of an ax and robbed of $400. During the 10-day trial, she testified that she could not positively identify her assailant, but said that Moore's voice sounded similar to that of her attacker.


Moore's attorney said his client ""was not the one who attacked Miss Eu,"" and would appeal the case.


The National Coalition for Redress Reparations (NCRR) is issuing an urgent appeal to redress supporters to call or write their members of Congress, asking them to vote for the Japanese American redress bill. The House measure, H.R. 442, comes to a House vote September 17. The bill would pay $20,000, each to Japanese Americans interned in relocation camps during World War II.


The current number of H.R. 442 co-sponsors is 167, or 52 short of the 218 needed to pass the bill and 123 short of the 290 needed to override a possible presidential veto.


On August 31, 17-year-old Gina Florio was sentenced to 25 years to life in prison for the brutal murder of Junko Owaki in February, 1986.

New Orleans Times-Picayune columnist James Welsh has provoked the wrath of Asian Americans by referring to Chinese American sheriff Harry Lee as a ""Chinaman"" in a recent editorial column.


Lee is running for re-election in Jefferson Parish.


Welsh wrote in an August 8 column. ""This race has something for everybody. You have a black, you have an Italian you have a Chinaman, you have a woman.""


A group of New Orleans Asian Americans demanded a public apology from the paper's owner and publisher and called for the resignation of Welsh In response to a letter of protest from the Asian group, the paper ran an item by Welsh repeating the sentence, substituting ""Chinese"" for ""Chinaman."" Welsh added, ""No offense was meant.""


A study of San Francisco school tast scores released last month reveals that students receiving bilingual education are scoring above the national average in language and math, the San Francisco Chronicle reports.


In reading, students who have been through bilingual education scored both above and below the national average, depending on grade level, district officials said. The test scores were taken from the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills, which was given in May to 53,000 children from kindergarten through the 11th grade.


An analysis showed black and Hispanic students scored lower than other ethnic groups and that children of Chinese, Japanese and Korean descent performed best.


An 83-year-old farm worker from Bakersfield, California was awarded the first Ninoy Aquino Leadership Award on August 21 by the Ninoy Aquino Movement.


Phillip V. Vera Cruz, who came to the U.S. in 1926, was second vice president of the United Farm Workers union during the mid-60s and 70s. Vera Cruz worked in the farmlands of Washington and California, and bused tables in Chicago and Seattle.


The award will be given each year to the person who exemplifies the principles of compassion and commitment to social justice adhered to by Benigno Aquino, husband of Philippine President Corazon Aquino. Benigno Aquino was assassinated in 1984 upon his return to the Philippines from the United States.

Congressman Robert Matsui wasted few words when asked about a possible presidential veto of the redress bill that was recently passed by the House of Representatives (see story below).


""It would be a tragedy if Ronald Reagan vetoed that bill,"" he said. He added that a veto could be a major setback for the Republican Party, given the GOP's recent success in recruiting Asian Americans to its ranks.


Matsui, the Democratic representative from Sacramento, California, was the keynote speaker at the Asian American Journalists Association convention in Los Angeles last month.


Matsui recounted his own experience of the internment. He was only six months old in April, 1942 when President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, but the effects of the evacuation lingered. When a junior high school teacher asked him about the experience, ""I shuddered,"" Matsui said.


""I was embarrassed because my only reaction was to think, 'My God, they're going to think I was a spy for the Japanese government.'""


He likened the silence of his parents' generation to the feelings of a rape victim. ""Society has the tendency to say if you're a victim of a rape you must have done something to have caused that act and what happened to these Japanese Americans was very similar.""


When Matsui and others first introduced the H.R. 442 in 1982, they only had 60 co-sponsors, mainly because many of their colleagues mistakenly believed the compensation would be for Japanese nationals interned in U.S. camps. As more members of Congress became aware that most of the internees were actually American citizens, support grew among both Democrats and Republicans.


Matsui recalled going to the office of Henry Hyde, the conservative Republican from Illinois and one of the stars of the Iran-Contra hearings. ""I showed him some pictures of the internment camps, explained what happened and he said, 'Put me on that bill. I'm a conservative, but one thing for sure, I believe in the Constitution.'""


The timing couldn't have been better for the House action, coinciding as it did with the 200th anniversary of the signing of the U.S. Constitution. ""I suppose that's why many members of Congress came up to Norm Mineta [Democrat of California] and myself after that vote with tears in their eyes,"" Matsui said. ""They said it this was one of the most gratifying votes that we could ever cast because we were really able to uphold the Constitution.""


""Even though it took some 45 years, we made sure that what we did 200 years ago had meaning.""


Matsui said he is hopeful of Senate passage and a presidential signature.

The Japanese American redress movement scored a major victory September 17, when the House of Representatives passed redress bill HR 442 with all major provisions intact by a vote of 243 to 141.


HR 442, if passed by the Senate and signed by the President, would implement the recommendations of the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians (CWRIC). These include a public apology from the U.S. government to all Japanese Americans unjustly interned during World War II, establishment of a public education trust fund, and $20,000 in monetary compensation to all living internees.


Meanwhile, Gordon Hirabayashi won an appeal of his 1942 conviction for defying the curfew orders imposed on Japanese Americans at the outbreak of World War II. The decision by the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals confirms Hirabayashi's argument that the singling out of the Japanese American community for detention and exclusion during World War II was never based on military necessity, but on racism.


Attention in Congress now shifts to the Senate, where a vote on S 1009, the companion bill to HR 442, is expected any day. Thanks largely to the leadership of Sen. Spark Matsunaga (D-Hawaii), S 1009 now has 76 co-sponsors and is expected to pass with no hostile amendments attached.


Following approval by the Senate, a conference committee of both houses must meet to iron out any differences between the House and Senate versions. From there, the bill goes to the White House for the President's signature.


Spokespersons in the Office of Management and Budget and the Justice Department have publicly recommended that President Reagan veto a redress bill should it get to his desk. A two-thirds majority in both houses would then be required to override the presidential veto. If this could not be obtained, as many observers believe, new redress legislation would have to be passed in the next Congress following the 1988 elections.


Reagan, however, has made no personal statement of his intent, and activists are hopeful that his opinion can be swayed.


John Ota, of the National Coalition for Redress and Reparations (NCRR), said, ""President Reagan was not expected to sign bills extending the Voting Rights Act or approving Martin Luther King's birthday a national holiday either, but he did sign due to the mass sentiment and public pressure applied to the White House.""


NCRR plans to mount a major letter-writing campaign, a grassroots lobbying delegation and will continue its National Redress Hotline for sending mailgrams to President Reagan. (Call 329-0172 for more information on the hotline.)


Tim Otani, director of the Pacific Northwest District of the Japanese American Citizens League (JACL), remains optimistic, declaring the House vote ""a tremendous victory."" JACL will closely monitor the Senate vote through its Legislative Education Committee. They hope to identify Republican supporters of redress who can aid in lobbying the White House in the coming months. Call 623-5088 if you would like to help.


The JACL, one of the oldest and largest Japanese American organizations nationwide has made redress a national priority for nearly 10 years. Following the House vote, National President Harry Kajihara stated, ""The passage of HR 442 . . . represents the ability of American democracy to restore itself, to correct past injustices and to strengthen the foundation of our constitutional freedoms and protections.""


The NCRR has also worked hard gathering grassroots support and lobbying for redress. They stated, ""With today's vote, prospects for winning redress are brighter than ever. But we still have a tough road ahead and there is no guarantee of final victory."" They point to two major hurdles still remaining: obtaining presidential approval or overriding a veto, then passage of an appropriations bill providing funds for redress.


Both groups credited several key supporters in the House of Representatives for passage of HR 442. House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Texas) was a highly influential voice in favor of the bill, Majority Leader Tom Foley (D-Wash.) acted as prime sponsor, and Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) served as floor manager for the bill. Reps. Norman Mineta (D-Calif.), Robert Matsui (D-Calif.) and Pat Saiki (R-Hawaii) were all active in lobbying their colleagues, while Rep. Mervyn Dymally (D-Calif.) provided strong support as did Rep. Ron Dellums (D-Calif.) and the rest of the Congressional Black Caucus.


Several hostile amendments were defeated en route to final passage of the bill. One amendment by Rep. Dan Lungren (R-Calif.) would have eliminated individual monetary compensation entirely. Another by Rep. Norman Shumway (R-Calif.) would have established a ""formula"" approach to monetary compensation, varying the amount of compensation according to age and length of time incarcerated thereby substantially reducing the total amount paid out.


While both amendments failed, the debate around them demonstrated that several Representatives still cannot distinguish Japanese Americans from foreigners and still believe the mass internment of citizens and resident aliens was justifiable under the Constitution.


Even some who voted for HR 442 expressed concern that redress would be too costly given the mammoth budget deficit or would set a precedent for redressing other historical injustices like the slavery of black people or the theft of Indian lands. Nonetheless, HR 442 enjoyed broad bipartisan support based on the clear-cut violations of constitutional and civil rights perpetrated on Japanese Americans in 1942.


Democrats voted in favor of redress 180 to 43, while Republicans voted 98 to 63 against the bill. The entire Washington state delegation voted in favor of HR 442 and against both hostile amendments. Many thanks are due to Rep. Mike Lowry (D-Wash.) who became the first active supporter of redress in the House nearly 10 years ago.


Redress supporters were jubilant last month. Major victories were won in the Hirabayashi case and in the House vote. While supporters agreed that final enactment of redress legislation faces a tough road, they remain confident that the dedication and community support that has brought the movement this far will prevail.

Asian American groups have denounced the use of the word ""Chinaman"" in the comic strip ""B.C."" that ran Oct. 5 in newspapers across the country, including the Seattle Post-Intelligencer.


The cartoon about life in the stone age is written by Johnny Hart and distributed by Creators Syndicate in Los Angeles.


Many Asian Americans consider ""Chinaman,"" which was first used derisively in the late 19th century, as offensive a term as ""nigger"" or ""Jap.""


Doris Nolan, general manager of Creators Syndicate, told Asian Week that no one at her company was aware the word was derogatory.


""We would not allow anything that we knew was offensive to go through our office, nor would Mr. Hart purposely offend anyone,"" she said.


Complaints should be sent to the P-I, 101 Elliott Ave. W., Seattle, WA 98119, 448-8051 or Creators Syndicate, 155 S. Sepulveda, #103, Los Angeles, CA 90025, (213) 477-2776.


Asian American students are getting mixed messages from the educational establishment. On the one hand, according to a report by the American College Testing (ACT) Program, they are scoring better than whites on college entrance exams. On the other hand, white students apparently are being admitted preferentially to some major universities.


The most recent evidence of this was a California state Auditor General's report that revealed white students had a better chance of getting into UC Berkeley than Asians, although the average Asian applicant has better grades.


Chief Deputy Auditor General Kurt J. Sjoberg told the San Francisco Chronicle the findings are not conclusive evidence of discrimination. But Ron Wakabayashi, national director of the Japanese American Citizens League, said the report ""reinforces"" Asian American concerns that the admissions process at Berkeley ""is not played on a level field.""


The ACT assessment showed Asian and Pacific Islanders had a composite score of 19.8 in 1987, up from 19.6 a year ago. White students had a score of 19.6; blacks, 13.4; Native Americans and Alaska natives, 14.6; Mexican Americans, 15.4; Puerto Ricans and other Hispanics, 16.9.


AIDS is an equal opportunity disease. Statistics show the epidemic is as serious in the Asian community as it is in the population as a whole.


In just six years, Asians have gone from zero to 2.6 percent of the AIDS cases in San Francisco, for example. Nationwide, a total of 249 Asians have been diagnosed with the disease.


Because AIDS at first affected Asians at a much lower rate than other groups, some researchers hypothesized that Asians had a biological resistance to it.


Medical authorities stress the need for AIDS education, especially for recent immigrants who don't have access to English-language information.


Racism was a factor in the alleged beating of a Korean man by two New York policemen, an Asian American activist group charges.


On Sept. 4, police stopped Yong Kook Ou, 20, for riding his bicycle against traffic in midtown Manhattan. According to witnesses, the two officers hauled Ou from his bike, threw him to the pavement and severely beat him for five to ten minutes.


Ou told the New York Times that the police called him ""scum"" and told him, ""If you don't cooperate, you're going to jail.""


He said that when he replied, ""Let's go there, I know my rights,"" the officers pushed him to the ground and began to hit him.


Police say Ou was asked for identification and that when he couldn't produce any, he became ""loud and vicious."" Ou was charged with traffic violations, disorderly conduct and obstructing governmental administration. He is due to appear in court Oct. 20.


In letters to Mayor Ed Koch and other city officials, the Coalition Against Anti-Asian Violence (CAAAV) expressed outrage at the ""racist treatment Ou received,"" and demanded that the charges against him be dropped. The group also demanded that the arresting officers be suspended and prosecuted for assault.


The CAAAV regards the incident as ""yet another clear-cut case of unprovoked police brutality against a person of color.""


Japanese geneticist Susumu Tonegawa has won the 1987 Nobel Prize in medicine for his work with antibodies. Tonegawa does research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston.

Others include General Mills with its Red Lobster chain and General Foods which is negotiating to buy the May Lee restaurants in Ithica, N.Y.

The mid-October convention of the National Democratic Counch of Asran and Pacific Americans (NDCAPA) proved to be a dramatic demonstration of growing Asian American political clout.


Three presidential candidates Michael Dukakis Jesse Jackson and Paul . . . the speakers at the organization . . . convention.


Jackson was received with the most enthusias . . . but it was Simon, the bespecta cled senator from Illinors, who out-promised the others by pledging if elected to name an Asian to his . . . among other high posts.


Equally impressive were the Asian American pacticrpants political veterans from across the nation who wasted little time in getting themselves organized. ""They knew what they wanted knew what had to be done and did it said Bob Santos, a Seattleite who attended the Los Angeles event. Santors is an aide to Congressman Mike Lowry.


More than 500 participants worked efficiently and with great purpose, Samos said, in work shops on power, brokering coalition building and voter registration, in discussions on and Asian violence, redress, trade and immigration and in forging the groups platform.


The major goal of the NDCAPA is to increase the role of Asian and Pacific Democrats in the 1988 presidential race, especially . . . delegates to the Democratic National Convention. Asian delegates to . . . convention jumped from three in 1980 to 103 in 1984, and Asian political activists . . . the figure will be even . . . next year.

The organizations included the NDCAPA the Japanese American Citizens League, the Organization of Chinese Americans, the Asian and the Asian-American Voters Coalition.


Can Filipino ""People Power"" work its wonders in . . . New York? Democratic . . . Solarz who is seeking re-election next fall, is hopeful.


In a recent campaign letter to about 50,000 Filipino Americans nationwide. Solar appealed for contributions, citing the continuing influence of Marcos's money. ""Ferdinand Marcos has made it clear that I am one of his most hated opponents."" Solarz wrote. ""I have clearly become has number one target in the United States...For someone who didn't hesitate to have his opposition climinated in the Philippines, and who has access to billions of dollars, funneling hundreds of thousands into an American election would be mere child's play.""


According to the Philippine American News Filipino Americans have responded positively in the past. In 1986, they gave the Solarz campaign about $90,000, which amounted to 15 percent of all contributions. Filipino Americans represent only one percent of the voting constituents in Solarz's district.


The outspoken congressman was one of Marcos's most vocal critics in Congress both before and after Marcos's fall from power in the Philippines.


Another political note: San Jose Congressman Norman Mineta has eridorsed Massachusetts Governor Michael Dakakis for the presidency. During a ceremony in San Jose last month, Mineta praised his fellow Democrat's ""dedication to excellence.""


""Mike's style is substance and not the other way around, unlike the present tenant in 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue,"" Mineta said.


C. William Verity . . . who was sworn in as U.S. Secretary of Commerce last month apologized for using the racial epithet ""Japs"" in a recent speech.


In an October 16 address at the University of South Carolina, Verity said, ""You have a reduction of inventory costs due to just-in-time delivery, a new concept that we had the Japs took and now we're going to take back.""


Despite a written apology. Asian American leaders reacted with swiftness and anger, noting that as Commerce Secretar Verity will often be dealing with the Japanese and other Asian nations.


Congressman Robert Maisui called the remarks ""a dangerous insult to Japanese, Americans and to all Americans who share a pride in their heritage.""


A group of angry parents has threatened a recall campaign against Los Angeles School Board member Warren Furutani after he provided the deciding vote last month for a plan to switch the entire district to a year-round schedule.


A few days later Furutani rever sed himself, voting to reconsider the proposal. He said the motion was necessary because the board did not give the public an adequate chance to voice its opinion on the issue.


Furutani a leader in the Asian American community for the past 20 years, acknowledged that his initial vote approving the plan was a hasty one. ""I made a mistake,"" he said. ""I admit it.""


But he insisted that, although the public should get another chance to air its views, he still favors the year-round schedule.


The U.S. Supreme Court last month refused to reopen the case of Minoru Yasui, one of three Nisei who protested the government's treatment of Japanese Americans during World War II.


After Yasui's death last November, a lower court ruled the case moot and dismissed it.


Two other men, Fred Kerematsu and Gordon Hirabayashi, fought successful court challenges of their convictions for breaking wartime restrictions on Japanese Americans.


Yasui's family filed a brief with the high court asking it to reconsider the decision not to hear the case.


Exerpts from an October 4 editorial on the Japanese American redress bill in the New York Times.


. . . 45 years later, Congress is moving to efface the shame and make amends for that wartime internment. Legislation providing for a formal apology, payments to victims and an education fund to preserve he lessons won passage in the House


Similar legislation is expected to pass the Senate by the end of the year.


But there is resistance within the Administration and it is unclear whether President Reagan will sign the bill. Not to do so would reinflame a grievous wrong.


""Government documents and newspaper accounts left no doubt. Racism and exenophobia were largely responsible for the government's decision to undertake internment and the Supreme Court's willingness to countenance it.


The Administration objects that the nation already has made amends for the internment with a 1948 law that paid out $37 million to settle 26,000 damage claims and with statements by President Ford that the internment was a mistake. It's a pinched and grudging position.


""Mistake doesn't begin to describe the wrong. It demands not a whispered admission of error, but a full-threated . . . Rep. Barney Frank who pried the bill out of the committees where it had languished since 1984, offers the right reason I think as a country we need this bill more than the victims.""

Presidential hopeful Jesse Jackson ""is far and away the best candidate on issues important to Asians and Pacific Islanders"" a California supporter told a gathering in Seattle earlier this month.


Alan Nishio, Southern California co-chair of Asians and Pacific Islanders for Jesse Jackson and chairperson of the National Coalition for Redress and Reparations, spoke at a November 4 reception to kick off the efforts of the newly-formed Seattle Chapter of Asians and Pacific Islanders for Jesse Jackson.


Nishio, who works as assistant vice president for student affairs at California State University at Long Beach, compared the struggle for monetary redress for Japanese Americans interned during World War II with Jesse Jackson's candidacy. Both, he said, are struggles for basic justice and reflect the enormous gains people can achieve by acting together for what they believe is right.


Nishio spoke in Seattle several weeks after the U.S. House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed a bill to pay $20,000 in monetary compensation, to each living internee, an accomplishment thought impossible 10 years ago when Congressman Mike Lowry introduced the first redress bill.


Nishio said passage of the redress bill was made possible, in part, by the efforts of a group of California Nisei and Sansei who journeyed to Washington, D.C. to lobby House members. Nishio said that one member of the group, a veteran of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, met with a Florida Congressman, also a veteran, and ultimately persuaded him to change his vote from no to yes. That same Congressman, in turn, convinced others in the Florida delegation to vote in favor of the bill, Nishio said.


At the recent convention of the National Democratic Council for Asians and Pacific Islanders in Los Angeles, Jackson was the most well received candidate, Nishio said.


As a candidate Nishio said, Jackson has tied the recent wave of anti-Asian violence to the greed of American corporations exporting jobs abroad. Similarly, Jackson has spoken out against the rising tide of American protectionist trade sentiment against Asian countries and has advocated, in its place, efforts to bolster the economies of Asian countries to help them attain self-sufficiency.


Nishio discounted claims that Jackson cannot win either the nomination or the general election. In fact, a Time magazine poll conducted in September showed that Jackson was by far the best known candidate and the first choice of 26 percent of all Democrats, 15 percent higher the Michael Dukakis, his closest challenger.


Nishio stressed the need to expand the number of voters and raise the consciousness of voters, especially those ignorant of how Jackson's promise of peace, justice and jobs can help all Americans. The wisdom of Nishio's advice is borne out by the fact that Reagan won the presidency in 1984 with only 65 million votes to Mondale's 35 million. But over 85 million eligible voters did not vote in the election.


The Seattle Chapter of Asians and Pacific Islanders for Jesse Jackson will hold a public education forum on the Jackson candidacy on Saturday. November 21 at 2 p.m. in the basement of the Bush-Asia Center at 409 Maynard Ave. S. A video presentation of Jackson's recent speeches will be on the program. For more information, call Stan Shikuma at 329-0172 or Gary Huie at 625-5118.


The group hopes to plan future events on voter registration drives, seek endorsements from local community groups, and hold informal house meetings to discuss Jackson's candidacy.

During World War II, Japanese American soldiers liberated the town of . . . France from its Hazi occupiers, . . . the townspeople want to repay the favor.


Two residents, Serge Carlesso and Pierre Moulin, have gathered 1,400 letters to President Reagan, urging him to sign the Japanese American redress bill. And they say they plan to collect thousands more.


In 1944 Bruyeres was the site of one of the bloodiest battles for the all-Japanese American 442nd Regimental Combat Team. In four days of brutal combat with German panzer forces, the Nisei soldiers suffered heavy casualties.


""While some in the U.S. seem to want to forget or gloss over the internment,"" said Bert Nakano of the National Coalition for Redress Reparations (NCRR), ""the people of Bruyeres will never forget the terrible sacrifices the men of the 442nd made to win their freedom, even though many of their families were held behind barbed wire back in the States.""


The redress bill was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives on September 17 and is still pending in the Senate. Reagan administration officials have indicated the President would veto the legislation for budget reasons.


As of mid-November, NCRR chapters had collected about 4,000 letters to Reagan towards its goal of 10,000. NCRR is appealing for donations to help cover the costs of its letter-writing campaign. Send contributions to NCRR, 244 S. San Pedro St. Room 406, Los Angeles, CA 90012.


An anonymous group has distributed at least two fliers to residents in Brooklyn, New York, accusing Chinese immigrants of drug trafficking and Koreans of being ""Moonies,"" Newsday reports.


The group has also called for a boycott of Asian-owned businesses in Brooklyn, warning of an Asian ""takeover"" in the borough.


The fliers, sent out to residents of Brooklyn's Gravesend and Bensonhurst neighborhoods, said Chinese newcomers were using ""laundered drug money"" to buy into the neighborhood and that Koreans were followers of the controversial religious leader, the Rev. Sun-myung Moon.


A spokeswoman for the Human Rights Commission declared the fliers illegal because they promote discrimination, but a New York police official held that the fliers are protected by the First Amendment.


City officials said they would investigate.
