**Regression analysis with time series data**

- Big data is a buzz word. However, still most of research projects are based on small and medium size data (between 1 and 10 GB). Collecting, cleaning, and merging these small and meidum data take serious efforts and care because they are usually unstructured and have widely different formats. Drawing a sound inference from them is also quite challenging as the data is small and noisy. I documented this project to demonstrate how we can tackle these small (in terms of size) and wide (in terms of formats) data and provide insights.

## Motivation

This project is part of my dissertation research. The main motivation of this project is to understand why Asian American and Latino community-based and advocacy organizations started to emerge in the 1960s and 1970s. Until the 1950s, Asian American and Latino communities were divided along national origin lines. Chinese, Japanese, and Filipino communities only minded their business. This is also true for the relationship between Mexicans, Cubans, and Puerto Ricans. However, in the 1960s and 1970s, these fragmented communities started to build organizations which represent their united voice. In my dissertation, I argued that this new trend emerged because Asian American and Latino activists were in competition with their African American counterparts in the federal grants market during this time period. Uniting their group helped them to increase their visibility and, thus, drew strong support from the War on Poverty programs (e.g., Community Action Programs, Community Development Centers, Community Health Clinics, etc.).

## Research design
The importance of the War on Poverty on the community building efforts among Asian Americans and Latinos was mentioned by previous studies. However, the evidence for the argument mostly came from anecdotal examples. This study provides the first systematic evidence for the influence of the War on Poverty programs on Asian American and Latino civic mobilization in the 1960s and 1970s. To do so, I focused on the difference in the organizational founding between the War on Poverty and the post-Reagan period. If my resource-driven theory were plausible, I hypothesize that then president Reagan's reduction of the budgets for these community support programs should have decreased the founding rate of these community organizations in the post-Reagan period.
